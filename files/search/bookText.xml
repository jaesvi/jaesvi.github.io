               The human genome and genomic variation


 1             A genome contains all the instructions needed to form and maintain an organism. The   1
               human genome is constituted by two times 3.2 billion nucleotides, which can be adenine
               (A), cytosine (C), thymine (T) or guanine (G). These are stored in long stretches that
                                                                                 1,2
               coil around each other forming a double helix of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) . The
               sequential order of these nucleotides establishes the differences between not only species,
               but also individuals. DNA is generally packed into chromosomes. Humans possess
               23 pairs of chromosomes in homeostasis, with one of each pair inherited from each
                        3
               progenitor . Parts of these chromosomes are organized into specific sequences called
               genes. Genes contain the code that the cellular machinery uses to construct proteins, the
               biomolecules that perform most of the cellular processes. There are about 20,000 protein-
               coding genes in the human genome, constituting only 1-2% of the total genome . The
                                                                                 4
               function of the vast majority of the remaining genome is not fully understood, although
                                                                                     5
               it is clear that a large fraction holds a regulatory function for the expression of the genes .

               The large majority (~99.5%) of the genomic sequence overlaps between two individuals .
                                                                                    3,6
               Most of the remaining alterations are neutral and have no effect, but some modify
               protein function by affecting genes or regulatory elements. Variants are responsible for
               the diversity in the population , but sometimes cause or predispose to diseases such
                                         7,8
                                          8,9
               as congenital disorders or cancer . Variants can be classified through different criteria.
               Depending on their origin, they can be germline, when inherited from the progenitors
               and therefore present in all cells of an organism; or somatic, when acquired during the
               lifetime of an individual through different processes of DNA damage and DNA repair
               errors. Germline or somatic variants can affect a single base in the genome (single
               nucleotide variants, SNVs) or several (multi nucleotide variants, MNVs), including
               small deletions and insertions (indels) (Figure 1). These small variants are the most
               common variants, although most are harmless polymorphisms 7,8,10 . However, variants
               can also affect large stretches of nucleotides and are then called structural variants (SVs).
               SVs consist of the rearrangement of large genomic segments (over 30 base pairs) within
               or between chromosomes 11,12  (Figure 1). There are two main classes of SVs: i) balanced
               or reciprocal, such as translocations and inversions, where the amount of DNA does
               not change and ii) unbalanced, such as deletions, duplications and insertions, where a
               change in the amount of DNA of a genome occurs. This amplification or loss of DNA
               segments is also called a copy number alteration (CNA). SVs are not as common as
               SNVs or MNVs. However, due to their larger size, they impact more bases in total in
                                                                                     15
               the genome 13,14 , they have an increased chance of impact on the homeostasis of the cell
               and they can also be the cause of human diseases such as neurodevelopmental disorders,
               autism or cancer by directly affecting key genes and regulatory mechanisms 8,11,12,16,17 .

            an arbitrary reference genome, of which two chromosomes are depicted here. (B) Simple variants include
            single nucleotide variants (SNVs), multi nucleotide variants (MNVs) and short insertions and deletions
            (indels). (C) Balanced structural variants (SVs) do not cause gain or loss of genomic material and include
            translocations between chromosomes and inversions. (D) Unbalanced SVs imply loss or gain of genomic
            material, and thus entail associated copy number alterations (CNAs). They can be deletions, insertions and
            duplications.


            Cancer is a genomic disease



            Cancer remains a major global health problem with over 18 million cases and 9 million
            deaths each year . Cancer is a term that englobes different diseases, all defined by an
                          18
            uncontrolled proliferation of  transformed  cells .  Due to a  combination of  inherited
                                                    9
            predisposing germline and acquired stochastic somatic SNVs, MNVs, SVs and
            epigenomic changes, cells may acquire selective growth advantage. Transformed cancer
            cells also acquire other characteristics to support their abnormal proliferation such
            as reduced cell death, angiogenesis stimulation, dysregulated metabolism, immune
            system evasion and migratory characteristics that allow them to metastasize to other
            tissues . As a result of the uncontrolled proliferation and dysregulated functions,
                  9
            cancer cells often have increased genomic instability and acquire even more somatic
            mutations. There is then a distinction between passenger events, which are acquired
            somatic mutations with no effect in tumorigenesis; and driver events, which are
            mutations that affect key genes and regulatory elements and are able to confer the
            selective growth advantage 19,20 . Typically there are up to a dozen driver mutations in
            a tumor, while there can be hundreds to hundreds of thousands passenger mutations

               depending on the tumor type . Genes affected by the driver mutations are called cancer
                                       20
               driver genes and can be further divided into oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
 1             Oncogenes acquire activating mutations that confer a positive selection advantage and   1
               act in a dominant way. Tumor suppressor genes drive cancer by inactivation or loss of
               activity often through bi-allelic mutations, which is the case for most familial cancers 20,21 .
               An example of a cancer driver gene is TP53. This gene encodes for the p53 protein,
               which monitors genomic integrity in the cell cycle and forces genetically damaged
               cells into senescence or apoptosis, hence its common moniker: “the guardian of the
               genome” . The BRAF kinase is also a known cancer driver, prevalent in melanoma and
                      22
               other cancer types . The constitutive activation of BRAF causes a dysregulation of the
                              20
               ERK-MAP signalling pathway, leading to increased cell proliferation and survival. The
               most common mutation in BRAF is the V600E substitution, although other mutations
               exist. The mutated protein is specifically targeted with BRAF inhibitors, improving the
               survival rates of patients with tumors carrying this specific alteration . This example
                                                                         23
               illustrates the importance of the identification of these driver mutations and genes for the
               treatment and prognosis of cancer, and can only be done through genomic technologies.

               During the mid-2000s affordable high-throughput sequencing became available
                                                                          26
               through platforms like 454 , SOLiD from Thermo Fisher , Solexa  and several
                                       24
                                                                  25
               others, encompassed under the umbrella term next-generation sequencing (NGS).
               Since then, throughput and price of these technologies has steadily improved, with the
               biotechnological company Illumina (after acquiring Solexa) as market leader. Thus,
               assays like whole-exome sequencing (WES), where the protein-coding part of the
               genome is sequenced, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) have become increasingly
               important in cancer research. Among countless techniques, knowledge and milestones
               unlocked by NGS are the development of large international cancer sequencing consortia
               such as ICGC , TCGA , PCAWG , HMF  or several focused on pediatric cancer 30–32 .
                          27
                                                  29

                                  28
               Through sequencing of these large cohorts our knowledge about the origin, behavior,
               evolution and actionability of tumors has greatly improved in the last decade. Although
               genomic data are already being used to guide treatment decisions in a variety of cancers,
               this is mainly done through targeted gene panels as WES and WGS are less used in
               clinical care than in research, mainly due to limitations in the availability of fresh-frozen
               tissue from the tumor biopsies in clinical practice and higher costs when compared to
               standard diagnostic techniques 33–35 . Nevertheless, WGS is the only technique that fully
               characterizes the genomic complexity and heterogeneity of a tumor. For this reason,
               together with technical improvements to reduce costs, there is little doubt that WGS
               will eventually be implemented routinely in cancer precision medicine . An additional
                                                                         36
               advantage of clinical implementation of WGS is the replacement of many standalone
               tests for different cancer types or mutation types, bringing in a single test for all cancers
               and harmonizing protocols for sample collections and data analysis .

            Precision medicine and liquid biopsies

     1      The genomic characterization of tumors allows the development of precision cancer                                                                                               1

            medicine: matching the best drug or treatment with the right patient based on the specific
            mutations present in the tumor 37–42 . Moreover, the combination of different mutations
            or the overall mutational landscape of a tumor -also known as mutational signatures -
                                                                                 43
            can only be discovered with WGS and also provides therapeutic opportunities 44–46 . Our
            knowledge of new actionable alterations evolves rapidly, therefore the comprehensiveness
            of WGS is also essential to be able to reassess data with new knowledge. Particularly,
            clinical trials can be designed based on particular cancer alterations rather than cancer
            type to increase sample sizes, which is particularly relevant to rare cancer types 35,47 . Other
            advantages of WGS implementation are the identification of secondary or multiple
            alterations to counterpart acquired resistance that emerge after prolonged cancer
            therapies 35,48  and the application in cancer immunotherapy and antitumor activity of the
            patients’ own immune system through tumor-specific neoantigen prediction 49,50 .


            Specific molecular profiling of each tumor is key for the development and application
            of precision oncology. Often, access to tumor material to perform WGS or other
            analyses is limited and depends on invasive procedures. There is therefore an increasing
            focus in oncology towards liquid biopsies, which are methods that analyze blood or
            other  biological  fluids  to derive  cancer  diagnostic  information 51–53 .  Due  to  their  low
            invasiveness, they can be repeated at multiple time points with less inconvenience for the
            patient. There are different analytes that can be investigated in liquid biopsies: circulating
            tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), extracellular vesicles or tumor-
            educated platelets . ctDNA are DNA molecules that are released to the bloodstream
                           51
            by dying cancer cells. These ctDNA fragments reflect comprehensively the genome of
            the tumor including SNVs, SVs and even other epigenomic alterations 53–55  (Figure 2A).
            Although apoptotic or necrotic normal cells also release their genomic content to the
            bloodstream (cell-free DNA, cfDNA) ctDNA molecules show a shorter size distribution
            than normal cfDNA for unclear reasons. The tumor-specific mutations can be detected
            from ctDNA by sequencing or with other sensitive approaches like digital-droplet
            PCR. Intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity and clonality are also reflected in ctDNA .
                                                                                  56
            There is a linear relationship between variant allele frequency (VAF) as found in ctDNA
            and tumor mass or load 57–59 . Furthermore, ctDNA has been found to have prognostic
            value in clinical trials 60,61 . The main applications of liquid biopsies are early diagnosis
            of cancer 62,63 , treatment selection and monitoring 54,64,65 , assessment of prognosis and
            risk of relapse 66,67  and minimal residual disease and recurrence monitoring through
            serial measurements 67–69 . The main limitations for further use of ctDNA in the clinic
            relate to the variation in ctDNA levels and VAF between patients 57,59  and confounding

                                                            51,52

               Ovarian cancer


               Ovarian cancer (OC) is a type of cancer that still has poor survival perspectives. Despite
               increased knowledge in OC etiology and molecular characteristics, patient survival rates
               have not improved in the last decades worldwide 72,73 . OC is a very heterogeneous disease
               with many subtypes. These subtypes differ in their cell of origin, molecular characteristics
               and disease prognosis 72,74 . Epithelial OC is more common and originates from different
               cell types surrounding the ovary, mainly from the fallopian tube, while the rarer non-
               epithelial OC subtypes arise from within the ovary 74,75 . The main histopathological type
               of epithelial OC is high grade serous carcinomas (HGSCs), which accounts for 70% of OC
               cases and deaths 73,76 . HGSCs are genomically characterized by somatic TP53 mutations
               and large copy number aberrations and aneuploidies. Moreover, half of the HGSCs
               show homologous recombination deficiency, mainly due to mutations in BRCA1 and
               BRCA2. However, besides these, few genes are recurrently mutated in these HGSCs 77,78 .
               Furthermore, one fifth of the OC cases are partially explained by germline variants in
               genes involved in DNA repair like BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, PALB1 or CHEK2 79–81 .
               Other subtypes of epithelial OC are low grade serous carcinomas (LGSC), endometrioid
               carcinomas (END), clear cell carcinomas (CCC) and mucinous carcinomas (MC). These
               subtypes harbor somatic mutations in different genes, such ARID1A, PTEN, PIK3CA,
               CTNNB1 and KRAS .
                                82
               The main treatment for patients with OC consists of debulking surgery and chemotherapy,
               mainly with a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel. However, OC often recurs with
               an acquired chemotherapy resistance, so there is a need for targeted treatments with less
               harmful side effects. For example several PARP-inhibitors have been recently approved
               for  patients  with OC  with  homologous  recombination  (HR)  deficiencies  due  to
               mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 or other genes in the HR pathway 83–85 . Furthermore, OC,
               especially HGSCs, presents with high inter- and intra-patient genomic heterogeneity 78,86 ,
               highlighting the need of patient-specific treatment approaches to improve prognosis in
               patients with OC.


               There is however limited success in oncology when translating therapeutics and drug
               development from scientific research to the clinic . Robust model systems of OC,
                                                          87

            and other carcinomas, are essential for preclinical cancer biology research and drug
            development 88,89 . Traditionally, there are two main types of cancer models: cancer
     1      cell lines and patient-derived tumor xenografts (Figure 2B). Both have contributed                                                                                              1
            enormously to cancer research. Cancer cell lines are derived from tumors and provide
            fast-growing everlasting models which are relatively easy to handle and experiment with.
            The first cancer cell line was HeLa, established from a cervical adenocarcinoma biopsy .
                                                                                  90
            HeLa cells have been widely used and have contributed to numerous breakthroughs not
                                                                         93
                                                 92
                               91
            only in cancer research , but also in virology  and even in research ethics  through a
            highly controversial trajectory 94,95 . Since, cancer cell lines derived from patient material
            have been established for different cancer types, including OC 96-99 . Furthermore, cancer
            cell lines often lose characteristics and cell heterogeneity of the original tumor 100,101 . For
            example, the two most used HGSC cell lines, SKOV3 and A2780, are not representative
            of the genomic characteristics of HGSC since they lack TP53 mutations and show near-
                                     100
            diploid copy number profiles . Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTXs) consist
            of fresh tumor material implanted subcutaneously or orthotopically into immuno-
            compromised mice 102,103 . The initial tumor can be then transplanted serially into an
            increasing number of mice, allowing drug screening in an in vivo model that mimics the
            tumor environment 104,105 . PDTXs have been developed for different OC subtypes, but
            mainly HGSC 106–108 . They have been shown to mimic chemotherapy and targeted therapy
            response in HGSC  109–113 . However, the use of PDTXs is expensive and time consuming,
                                                                      114
            making it less suitable for rapid and high-throughput drug screening . Additionally,
            recent evidence suggests that PDTXs might undergo mouse-specific tumor evolution
                                                                              116
            that differ from that of the patient , although that is currently a subject of debate .

            Organoids as a cancer model

     1      In the last decade, organoids have emerged as a novel tridimensional model system                                                                                               1

            for normal tissues and cancer (Figure 2B). The first organoids were generated from
            intestinal stem cells, which were grown embedded in Matrigel by mimicking in vivo
            stem cell conditions to form the characteristic crypt-villus structures . Since, organoids
                                                                   117
            have been cultured from a plethora of normal tissues, extensively reviewed in ,

            including fallopian tube . Organoids derived from healthy tissue have been shown to
                                119
            expand long-term while remaining genomically stable . They have been used to study

            Organoids  can  also  be  generated  using  patient-derived  tumor  tissue 124,125 .  Successful
            tumor-derived organoids were first established from patients with colorectal ,

            healthy) organoid biobanks have been generated from multiple patients with
            colorectal 128,129 , pancreatic 130–132 , liver , head and neck  and breast  cancer. These
                                                                      135

                                           133
            efforts have shown that tumor-derived organoids maintain the genomic and phenotypical
            characteristics of the original tumor they were derived from even after long term
            culturing 124,125,136 . Tumor-derived organoids have also been used for high throughput
            drug screening and can be xenografted into mice to assess in vivo drug response while
            maintaining the original histopathological characteristics .

            There are several limitations of organoid technology for (translational) cancer research.
            Tumor organoid cultures might suffer overgrowth by healthy cells with less mitotic error
            rates, which can be circumvented with highly pure tumor starting material or culture with
            selective conditions depending on the driving mutations of the original tumor 120,123,129,135 .
            Also, organoid cultures are more time- and resource-intensive compared to traditional
            cell lines, and the tumor microenvironment is still not reflected, with missing blood
            vessels or immune cells , although efforts towards co-cultures that better mimic the in
                               136
            vivo situation are underway .
                                   137
            Importantly, different tumor-derived organoids have been shown to recapitulate drug
            responses in the clinic 138–140 . Since patient-derived tumor organoids are genomically and
            phenotipically closer to original tumors than 2D cell lines, they might be a better model
            for drug screening while maintaining high-throughput characteristics. Furthermore, if
            they could be derived from patients in a sufficiently rapid manner, they might be used
            to study patient-specific tumor characteristics and to rapidly screen for the effectiveness
            of targeted treatments. Some of the different tumor-derived organoids have been readily

               used to explore targeted treatments. Drug screening in breast cancer organoids with
               several drugs targeting the HER signalling pathway revealed that specific organoid
 1             responses depend on HER2 expression status . Separately, prostate cancer organoids   1
                                                     135
               with androgen receptor (AR) amplification showed higher sensitivity to enzalutamide,
                                                    127
               an AR inhibitor, than the rest of the organoids . Overall, despite several limitations and
               awaiting larger cohort clinical characterizations, organoids have emerged as exciting and
               promising in vitro models to bridge the gap between bench cancer research and clinical
               care.



               Structural variation in cancer


               One of the aforementioned hallmarks of cancer, particularly relevant in OC, is
               chromosomal instability . Directly related to genomic instability are SVs and in particular
                                   9
               somatic SVs. As previously discussed, SVs and copy number alterations (CNAs) have a
               critical role in tumorigenesis  and most tumors bear a considerable amount of somatic
                                      141
               SVs. Furthermore, it has been shown that some cancers are primarily driven by somatic
               SVs, e.g. high grade serous ovarian , esophageal , neuroblastoma , small-cell lung
                                                                       143
                                                        142
                                             77
               cancer  and triple-negative breast cancer , with the majority of somatic SV events
                     144
                                                  145
               being non-recurrent even within cancer types .
                                                    146
               Apart from the simple deletion, inversion, translocation, duplication and insertion SV
               events previously described, more complex SV phenomena with multiple clustered
               genomic rearrangement are very common in cancer. Breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB)
               events, which are the consequence of cycles of DNA breakage and sister-chromatid fusion
               that cause a dicentric chromosome that bridges during cell division, leading to further
               breakages. BFB events show oscillating copy number changes surrounded by fold-back
               inversions 147–150 . Chromoplexy is a series of chained rearrangements involving several
               chromosomes resulting from simultaneous double stranded breaks that are erroneously
               repaired 150,151 . Chromothripsis involves a single chromosome shattering which creates up
               to hundreds of rearrangements in a single event. Chromothripsis is localized to a single
               or a few chromosomes 152–155 , and recent estimates show that up to 40% of all tumors
               display chromothripsis events .
                                       156

               There are diverse mechanisms through which somatic SVs can drive cancer : oncogene
                                                                            146
               amplification via copy number alterations ; oncogenic gene fusions through deletions,
                                                 157
               translocations or inversions ; tumor-suppressor inactivation through deletion or gene
                                      158
               disruption, often coupled to inactivating mutations in the other allele, common for TP53
               or BRCA1 inactivation in ovarian and breast cancer 77,159 ; or promoter, enhancer or other


                                                                                       11]]></page><page Index="20"><![CDATA[CHAPTER 1



            regulatory elements hijacking . Overall genomic instability metrics or specific somatic
                                    160
            SV signatures that reflect specific DNA damage can be clinically useful biomarkers .
                                                                               161
     1      There are examples of therapeutically actionable somatic SVs regardless of their                                                                                                1

            oncogenic mechanisms. For example, the amplification of ERBB2 causes overexpression
                                                                         162
            of HER2 in breast cancer patients, which can be treated with trastuzumab . Also, the
            prototypical BCR-ABL1 gene fusion in chronic myeloid leukemia, also known as the
                                                                          37
            Philadelphia chromosome, is treatable with the specific inhibitor imatinib . SVs also
            represent an exciting opportunity in liquid biopsies. Copy number alterations and
            chromosomal rearrangements can be identified through WGS or targeted approaches
            in ctDNA from plasma 55,163,164 . Furthermore, somatic SVs may serve as a different type
            of tumor-specific biomarker to detect and quantify ctDNA with high sensitivity in liquid
            biopsies through junction-spanning quantitative and highly sensitive PCR assays 165,166 .

            Traditionally, SVs in cancer have been clinically detected using cytogenetic techniques
            like fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) 167,168 , which works well for hematological
            malignancies but is restricted to specific known targets and has limited application in
            solid tumors . An alternative technology is array comparative genomic hybridisation
                       146
            (aCGH), which offers higher throughput and has been applied in both research and the
            clinic 146,169,170 . However, aCGH is only applicable to unbalanced SVs and suffers from low
            resolution and higher costs than sequencing approaches . Furthermore, sequencing
                                                           146
            approaches offer the possibility to identify other alterations than SVs in the same assay.
            Therefore, most of our knowledge about the role of SVs in cancer genomes stems from
            the analysis of short-read WGS data, which can be supported by additional sample
            preparation techniques like paired-end sequencing or long-insert mate pair sequencing
            to enhance the SV detection power 155,171,172  (Figure 3).


            There are however some inherent pitfalls to short-read sequencing technologies regarding
            SV detection. The main problem is that SVs, especially in the germline, are enriched in
            the vicinity or within repetitive DNA 16,173 . Repetitive DNA complicates short-read data
            analysis since reads may map to different locations in the genome, with a greater chance
            of ambiguous mapping with shorter read length 8,174,175 (Figure 3). Furthermore, the short
            read-length hinders mapping across SV breakpoints. As a result, there are genomic
            regions and variation that might have remained inaccessible due to these technological
            constraints 176–178 .

               Long-read sequencing


 1             In the last several years new sequencing technologies have become available that alleviate   1

               these biases, which are often referred to as third-generation or long-read sequencing
                         177
               technologies . One approach is to generate synthetic long reads using long DNA
               fragments that are sheared and barcoded separately. The barcoded sheared fragments can
               be then sequenced on existing short-read sequencers. The relation of the short reads can
               be thus reconstructed by using the shared barcodes(Figure 3), hence the name linked

               reads 179,180 . This technology is commercialized by 10X Genomics and also has important
               applications for single-cell sequencing 181,182 .


               The other two main long-read sequencing technologies are from Pacific Biosciences
               (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT). Both have in common that they
               do single-molecule sequencing without relying on amplification of DNA fragments
               and thus eliminating those biases and allowing the sequencing of longer stretches of
               DNA, routinely reaching average read lengths of 10kb and over 100kb 183,184 . They also
               share a main limitation, the higher per-base error rate (typically 5-15%) which is also
               biased in indels and low complexity genomic regions . Also, the higher amount of
                                                            177
               input DNA required to avoid the amplification step might be a limitation for cancer
               medicine applications. The approach from PacBio, named single-molecule real-time
               (SMRT), uses very small wells with a fixed polymerase that adds labelled nucleotides to
               a single DNA strand, coupled to an imaging system 185,186 . Furthermore, to mitigate the
               error rates a circular consensus sequencing (CCS) can be generated, where a circularized
                                                                 184
               DNA molecule passes multiple times through the polymerase . Nanopore sequencing
               records the change of electrical current when a DNA molecule traverses biological pores
               embedded in a membrane. The distinct voltage change depends on the composition of
               the specific nucleotide(s) present in the pore at a particular moment 187,188 . Therefore,
               ONT has unlocked new genomic applications such as direct measurements of RNA
               molecules 189–191  and RNA and DNA modifications 192–195 . Nanopore sequencing offers
               improved read lengths, lower costs and higher throughput than PacBio, with similar
               error rates but a more biased error profile . Efforts to improve the error profiles include
                                                177
               pore bioengineering and specific base-calling models.

               Long-read sequencing technologies have contributed to expanding the knowledge about
               structural variation in the last years. Thanks to the increased read length, unambiguous
               split-mapping across SV break-junctions is easier to achieve (Figure 3). Using these
               new technologies, new areas of the genome previously hidden become accessible like
               segmental duplications and centromeres  196–198 . Long-read sequencing studies in healthy
               populations estimate over 25,000 SVs in the germline genome, which is a 3 to 7 fold


                                                                                       13]]></page><page Index="22"><![CDATA[CHAPTER 1



            increase in SV detection over previous studies using NGS 196,199–203 . Other studies have
            proven the efficacy of long reads to detect SVs relevant in congenital disease 204–207 .
     1      Similarly, recent works have explored the use of long-reads to uncover somatic SVs in                                                                                           1

            Figure 3: Structural variation detection using different sequencing technologies. Structural variants
            (SVs) are detected using different approaches for the different sequencing data, as depicted here for a deletion
            (similar approaches apply to other types of SVs). (A) To detect SVs from short-read sequencing data, there
            are three inference approaches: i) Differences in the sequencing depth, which only works for unbalanced
            SVs such as deletions (lower sequencing depth), insertions and duplications (increased depth). ii) Split read
            alignment where a read maps separately in different genomic locations. It is algorithmically challenging to
            unequivocally map the shorter fragments of a split read. iii) Unexpected distance and orientation between
            paired reads if using paired-end sequencing  (B) Inconsistencies within barcode groups distance and
            orientation are used to detect SVs from linked-reads (C) SVs can be detected from long-read sequencing
            by using the split alignments, similarly to short-read data. Unambiguous mapping of these split reads is less
            challenging due to the increased length of the fragments.



            To unlock the full potential of these long-read sequencing technologies, dedicated
            bioinformatics pipelines are needed. Although the core algorithms are similar, these
            new data types present new challenges due to their increased read length and higher
                     176
            error rates . Long-read sequencing has proven to be suitable in a clinical setting 203,212 ,
            however analysis pipelines and best practices need to be standardized. In order to validate
            and benchmark different technologies and analysis pipelines, the availability of high-
                                              175
            quality unbiased reference sets is essential . For SVs, germline benchmarks that include
            orthogonal data from multiple sequencing technologies have become available 199,213 .
                                                                                 214
            However in cancer genomics this type of benchmarks are only available for SNVs ,
            therefore hindering the advancement of somatic SV discovery and application.

               Thesis outline


 1             This thesis focuses on genomic technology and its application in advancing cancer   1


               research and care, presenting several resources and techniques relevant for the
               community. In Chapter 2, we present an OC organoid biobank and demonstrate
               that the genomic and transcriptomic characteristics from the tumor of origin are
               maintained in the corresponding organoids. In Chapter 3, we expand on the application
               of OC organoids and include drug screening, demonstrating genomic and response
               heterogeneity in organoids also present in patients. In Chapter 4, we integrate genomic
               data from multiple technologies to develop a somatic SV truth set essential for the
               development and benchmarking of somatic SV calling methods. In Chapter 5 we use the
               nanopore sequencing technology to develop an assay to rapidly detect somatic SVs from
               a tumor. These somatic SVs were then used to track the dynamics of a tumor. In Chapter
               6 we describe the application of targeted nanopore sequencing in pediatric leukemia to
               close gaps in current diagnostic approaches to detect genomic biomarkers for minimal
               residual residual disease. Finally, in Chapter 7 I reflect on the results discussed in the rest
               of chapters and pose challenges and limitations for future research.

               Abstract



               Ovarian cancer (OC) is a heterogeneous disease usually diagnosed at a late stage. Ex-
               perimental in vitro models that faithfully capture the hallmarks and tumor heterogene-
               ity of OC are limited and hard to establish. We present a protocol that enables efficient
 2             derivation and long-term expansion of OC organoids. Utilizing this protocol, we have   2

               established 56 organoid lines from 32 patients, representing all main subtypes of OC.
               OC organoids recapitulate histological and genomic features of the pertinent lesion from
               which they were derived, illustrating intra- and interpatient heterogeneity, and can be
               genetically modified. We show that OC organoids can be used for drug-screening assays
               and capture different tumor subtype responses to the gold standard platinum-based che-
               motherapy, including acquisition of chemoresistance in recurrent disease. Finally, OC
               organoids can be xenografted, enabling in vivo drug-sensitivity assays. Taken together,
               this demonstrates their potential application for research and personalized medicine.

            Introduction



            Over the past decade, the field of epithelial OC research has gone through a dramatic
            shift led by a series of recent discoveries 72,73 . It has become clear that OC is a heteroge-
            neous disease consisting of a wide spectrum of distinct molecular and clinical entities.
     2      Epithelial ovarian neoplasms can be divided into three main groups: borderline tumors                                                                                           2

            (BTs; non-carcinoma) and type I and type II tumors (carcinomas) 215,216 . BTs account for
            15% of OC malignancies and consist primarily of serous BT (SBT) and mucinous BT
            (MBT) subtypes. BTs are frequently found adjacent to type I tumors and share many
            of their characteristics. It is therefore believed that they can transform into type I tu-
            mors . Type I tumors are genetically stable and carry a distinct set of frequently mutated
                 215
            genes, including, KRAS, BRAF, PTEN and CTNNB1 215,216 . There are four main type I
            subtypes: low-grade serous (LGS), mucinous (MC), endometrioid (END) and clear cell
                            216
            (CCC) carcinomas . Type II tumors comprise high-grade serous (HGS) tumors, which
                                                                       73
            are the most common type of OC and account for 70–80% of mortalities . HGS tumors
            frequently carry mutations in the TP53 (96%), BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (20%), and are
            an extreme example of chromosomally unstable cancer 77,217 . HGS tumors are believed to
                                                           216
            develop either from the fimbria of the fallopian tube (FT)  or from the ovarian surface
            epithelium (OSE). However, the relative contribution of these tissues to tumor develop-
                                 218
            ment is still under debate .

            Tumor cell lines and patient-derived tumor xenografts are the most commonly used
            human model systems for the study of OC 99,219–222 . Despite their contribution to cancer
                                                       223
            research, these models have a number of drawbacks . Establishing a new cell line is a
            challenging and time-consuming process that involves a long period of fibroblast con-
            tamination reduction and has a low success rate. Thus, in many cases, the resulting cell
            lines are the product of a strong in vitro selection, which inevitably leads to the loss of
            tumor molecular characteristics, including copy number variations (CNVs), mutations
            and intrapatient heterogeneity . In contrast to two-dimensional cell lines, xenografts re-
                                     100
            liably recapitulate components of the tumor environment, such as the three-dimensional
            structure and the interaction of cancer cells with stroma and blood vessel infiltration .
                                                                                 224
            Nevertheless, xenografts involve significant investments in resources for their mainte-
            nance, are poorly suited for large-scale drug screening or for genetic manipulation, and
            undergo rapid mouse-specific tumor evolution . To overcome these drawbacks and
                                                   115
            to allow personalized approaches to cancer treatment, novel OC research platforms are
            needed 72,73,224 .


            As first shown for colorectal cancer , tumor organoid cultures represent robust three-di-
                                        120
            mensional in vitro systems that faithfully recapitulate the tumor from which they are

               derived 126–129 . Organoid technology is based on the definition of a cocktail of growth
               factors and small molecules (used in conjunction with the basement membrane mimic
               Matrigel) to recreate the niche requirements for long-term growth of cells. Organoid cul-
               tures can be clonally established from single cells derived from tumor tissue, allowing the
                                       125
               study of tumor heterogeneity . Organoids allow rapid assaying of phenotype–genotype
 2             correlations and drug sensitivity, while recapitulating patient response 128,135,138,225 . The po-  2
               tential of organoid platforms for OC research was illustrated in a recent paper in which
               short-term cultured HGS organoids (7–10 d) were genomically characterized and then
                                                                  226
               used in various assays to study DNA repair inhibitor response . Here we present and
               characterize an OC research platform that supports the efficient derivation and long-
               term expansion of OC organoids corresponding to non-malignant BTs, as well as MC,
               CCC, END, LGS and HGS carcinomas.



               Results
               Derivation of OC organoids


               OC tissue and blood were obtained from consenting patients who underwent tumor re-
               section and/or drainage of ascites/pleural effusion, either before or after (neoadjuvant)
               chemotherapy (Supplementary Table 1). For each cancer case, the available tissue was
               used for organoid derivation, DNA isolation and histological analysis. Tumor pieces des-
               ignated for organoid derivation, were further dissociated and the isolated tumor cells
               were suspended in basement membrane extract (BME), plated and supplemented with
               medium (Extended Data Figure 1a).


               We used a recently described FT organoid medium  as our starting point for OC me-
                                                         119
               dium optimization. To improve organoid derivation rate, compounds that follow two
               main guiding criteria were tested as additives to the FT baseline medium: (1) compounds
               previously reported to be highly expressed in ovarian tumors and therefore hypothe-
               sized to support OC growth 227,228  and (2) factors used to support OC cell growth 229,230  and
               other types of tumor organoids 126,135 . We noted that addition of hydrocortisone, forskolin
               and heregulinβ-1 to FT medium improved the efficiency of OC organoid derivation. We
               also observed that Wnt-conditioned medium, an essential component of the FT medi-
               um, was not essential for all tumor organoid lines. Moreover, it had a negative effect on
               some of the lines, presumably due to the presence of serum in the conditioned medium
               and not Wnt itself. Therefore, we used two types of OC medium for organoid derivation:
               with (‘OCwnt medium’) or without (‘OC medium’) Wnt-conditioned medium (Supple-
               mentary Table 2). Typically, it became obvious after two to three passages which of the
               two media was optimal for individual OC cultures. OC organoid growth rates showed


                                                                                       21]]></page><page Index="30"><![CDATA[CHAPTER 2



            significant variability between cases, with passaging intervals varying from one to four
            weeks and split ratios ranging from 1:1.5 to 1:4 (Supplementary Table 3). Organoids
            could be expanded long-term, that is, at the time of final submission, 22 lines had been
            passaged more than 15 times and four lines more than 30 times without slowing down
            (Extended Data Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 3). Organoids could be cryopre-
     2      served and efficiently recovered (85% success rate, n=33; Supplementary Table 3).                                                                                               2
            OC is often diagnosed after the tumor has already metastasized. In some cases, we were
            able to obtain both the primary tumor and the different metastatic lesions. We were
            therefore able to derive multiple organoid lines from individual patients. In one case,
            we established primary and recurrent tumor organoids from the same patient. In total,
            we established 56 organoid lines, derived from 32 different patients. Organoids were de-
            rived with a success rate of 65%, representing both pre-malignant and malignant neo-
            plasms covering the spectrum of OC, including MBT, SBT, MC, LGS, CCC, END and
            HGS (Figure 1a and Supplementary Table 4). OC organoid nomenclature is based on
            their histopathological subtype and a number that refers to patient and tumor location.
            Patient clinical data are presented in Supplementary Table 1.



            Derivation of normal FT and OSE organoids from BRCA germline mutation carriers


            Women with germline mutations in the BRCA1/BRCA2 genes are at high risk of de-
            veloping OC 231,232 . Therefore, organoids from normal FT and OSE of these individuals,
            in addition to non-carriers, should provide a valuable resource for research on the early
            stages of tumor development. We obtained FT and ovarian tissue from women under-
            going prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (pBSO). As previously reported for
            FT organoids , pBSO-derived FT organoids were visible within 3–4 d after isolation,
                       119
            displayed a rounded, cystic phenotype and could be maintained long-term. Consistent
            with their tissue of origin, FT organoids expressed markers of both secretory and ciliated
            cells (PAX8 and acetylated-α-tubulin, respectively), and contained beating ciliated cells
            (Extended Data Figure 3a–c and Supplementary Video 1). OSE organoids displayed
            a slower growth rate compared with FT organoids. They were usually visible 1–2 weeks
            after plating and could be passaged once every 2–3 weeks for extended periods of time.
            OSE organoids displayed a cystic phenotype and expressed cytokeratin 8, demonstrat-
            ing their epithelial origin (Extended Data Figure 3d). In total, we were able to derive
            (success rate >90%) FT organoids from ten pBSO-patients and OSE organoids from six
            pBSOpatients. In addition, we derived two FT lines from non-carriers. Normal organoid

               Morphological and histological characterization of OC organoids


               Normal FT and OSE organoid lines consistently displayed a cystic morphology with
               some epithelium folds and invaginations, which appeared on organoid maturation (Ex-
               tended Data Figure 3). In contrast, OC organoids showed wide morphological variation
 2             between and within distinct histological subtype groups (Extended Data Figure 1b,c).   2
               Most BT organoids were cystic, whereas MC, LGS, END and CCC organoids formed
               denser organoid structures harboring multiple lumens. HGS organoids presented a wide
               morphological spectrum, varying from cystic to dense with different degrees of circular-
               ity and cellular cohesiveness (Extended Data Figure 1c,d). Scanning electron micros-
               copy (SEM) revealed that morphological heterogeneity was not restricted to organoid
               shape, but also occurred at the cellular level (Extended Data Figure 1c). Moreover, SEM
               showed different degrees of cellular organization, as evidenced by cellular cohesiveness
               and microvilli alignment.

               To compare organoids to their corresponding tumor tissue, we performed hematoxylin
               and eosin (H&E) staining and evaluated expression of OC protein biomarkers, such as
               paired box gene 8 (PAX8) and tumor protein p53. Of note, the tumor organoids con-
               sist of the transformed epithelial cells of a tumor, but do not contain immune, vessel or
               connective tissue elements. Histological analysis of the primary tumor tissue used for
               organoid derivation revealed different degrees of normal cell contamination as indicated
               by H&E and p53 staining (Extended Data Figure 2c). This stressed the need for histo-
               logical analysis of the primary tissue used for organoid derivation, as low tumor purity
               can influence organoid derivation efficiency and genomic correlation between organ-
               oids and tissue.

               H&E staining of OC organoids revealed multiple tumor characteristics, such as the pres-
               ence of papillary-like structures, nuclear and cellular atypia, and features of hobnail cells
               (Figure 1 and Extended Data Figure 1d). These characteristics were not detected in
               normal FT and OSE organoids, which, in contrast, displayed well-organized epithelium
               (Extended Data Figure 3). Moreover, in an H&E-based blinded test conducted by a cer-
               tified pathologist on samples from normal FT and OSE organoids (n=5) as well as OC
               organoids (n=18), only FT and OSE organoids were classified as ‘normal’. OC organoids
               were either classified as ‘non-definitive’ (n=5, 28%) or malignant (n=13, 72%). OC organ-
               oids that were classified as ‘non-definitive’ corresponded to BT and LGS tumors (n=4 and
               n=1, respectively). In agreement with their histological classification, most MBT and MC
               organoid lines were positive for periodic acid–Schiff (9 out of 11) and negative for PAX8
               (7 out of 11) staining, the latter a hallmark that distinguishes ovarian mucinous and se-
               rous tumors (Figure 1c and Supplementary Table 6) . Ovarian serous organoids that

                                                                                       23]]></page><page Index="32"><![CDATA[CHAPTER 2



            were tested retained PAX8 and p53 expression status as observed for their correspond-
            ing tumor tissue (Figure 1d,e, Extended Data Figure 2e and Supplementary Table 6).
            Mutations in the TP53 gene can lead to diverse patterns of p53 staining, such as protein
            loss or strong nuclear staining. Such patterns were observed in different HGS organoid
            lines and their corresponding tumor tissue and were in agreement with their sequencing
     2      data (Figure 1e and Supplementary Table 7). Organoids displayed a high percentage                                                                                               2
            of Ki67-positive cells (Extended Data Figure 2b). Thus, histological analysis of OC or-
            ganoids demonstrated their similarity to the carcinoma fields within the corresponding
            primary tumors and their distinction from non-malignant FT and OSE organoids.


            Organoids faithfully recapitulate OC at the genomic level


            To further validate that OC organoids are composed of malignant cells, we performed
            metaphase spread analysis. The majority of tested organoid lines were aneuploid, a
            well-characterized hallmark of most solid tumors . Interestingly, in some cases, a sig-
                                                     234
            nificant variation in average chromosome number was observed for different organoid
            lines derived from the same patient (Figure 2a).
            To determine whether OC organoids faithfully recapitulate the genomic landscape of
            the primary tumors from which they were derived, we next performed whole-genome
            sequencing (WGS) analysis. In total, we sequenced 40 organoid lines from 22 different
            patients. The corresponding tumor and normal blood samples for 35 of these lines were
            also sequenced and used as a reference (Supplementary Table 7). We first used WGS
            data to estimate the percentage of malignant cells in both organoid and tumor samples .
                                                                                  29
            As predicted from histological analysis, in most cases, cancer cell content of organoids
            was considerably higher than that of the corresponding tumor (tumor organoids 88.1
            ± 23% versus tumor tissue 45.1 ± 9.2% (mean ± s.d.) across all samples; Extended Data
            Figure 2d and Supplementary Table 7). CNV analysis revealed similar patterns between
            organoid/tumor pairs (Figure 2b and Extended Data Figure 4a). Moreover, comparing
            the genomic landscape from early and late passage HGS organoids revealed that CNVs
            were well maintained even after prolonged passaging (HGS-1, passage eight versus 32;
            HGS-2, passage six versus 15; HGS-3.1, passage four versus 32; HGS-3.2, passage four
            versus 25; HGS-6, passage eight versus 21; HGS-1-R2, passage four versus 17; Figure 2c
            and Extended Data Figure 4a). Most organoids derived from HGS tumors displayed
            many CNVs, whereas organoids derived from type I tumors and BTs revealed a relatively
            subtle number of CNVs (Figure 2b and Extended Data 4a). Thus, OC organoids reca-
            pitulate the genomic characteristics of the different OC subtypes from which they are
            derived 216,235 .

            tissue. Mutations in the TP53 gene can lead to protein loss, as presented by the HGS-6 organoid/tumor pair,
            or strong nuclear staining, presented by the HGS-3.1 organoid/tumor pair. Histological characterization
            across the different organoid lines is presented in Extended Data Figure 2e and Supplementary Table 6. Scale
            bar, 100 μm.



     2      To further quantify genetic correlation between organoids and corresponding tumors,                                                                                             2
            we analyzed somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and structural variants (SVs).
            Most SNVs and SVs present in the original tumor were maintained in the organoids de-
            rived thereof, and vice versa (Extended Data Figs. 4b and 5a). Shared mutations were
            also maintained after extended passaging (Extended Data Figure 4b). Some organoid
            lines, such as HGS-19, HGS-3.1 and MC-2.1, presented marked differences with their
            corresponding tumor sample (Extended Data Figure 5a). We believe that these differ-
            ences result from low tumor cell content within the original tumor samples as evident
            from their low number of SNVs, SVs and the lack of obvious CNVs (Extended Data
            Figure 4).

            Next, we tested whether organoids displayed known OC-associated somatic mutations,
            amplifications and deletions. Somatic mutations in KRAS and BRAF genes, which are
            frequently found in MC and LGS tumors 236,237 , were identified in the corresponding or-
            ganoid subtypes (MC-1, MC-2 (KRAS), LGS-5 (BRAF); Figure 3 and Supplementary
            Table 7). Moreover, all organoids derived from HGS tumors showed non-silent muta-
            tions including missense, stop gain and frameshifts in the TP53 gene, in some cases ac-
            companied by the loss of the second allele (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 7). Am-
            plifications of MYC and CCNE1 as well as loss of RB1, PTEN and CDKN2A/B genes
            (frequent in HGS tumors 77,238 ) were observed (Figure 3). These oncogenic modifications
            were mostly conserved between organoids and corresponding tumors (Figure 3 and
            Supplementary Table 7).

            DNA methylation analysis was performed on a subset of organoids at early and late time
            points, using Illumina Infinium methylationEPIC 850K BeadChip. Clustering of these
            organoid samples based on the methylation beta-values demonstrated that organoids
            maintained their epigenetic profile after extended passaging (Extended Data Figure
            5b), as found previously for colorectal cancer organoids .

            OC organoids capture tumor heterogeneity

            ganoid lines derived from one primary and three metastatic sites of a patient diag-
            nosed with LGS OC (Figure 4a). CNV analysis revealed losses and gains shared by
            all tumor lesions from the same patient (for example, loss of chromosome X) as well
            as copy number changes only present in the metastatic sites (for example, loss of 17p
            in LGS-1.2,3,4; Figure 4a). These CNVs are conserved between tumor tissue and the

               by independent component analysis that revealed five distinct clusters (Figure 4b).

            Clusters 1–4 comprised aneuploid cells whereas cluster 5 comprised dip-
            loid cells (Figure  4c). As expected, tumor samples that were obtained from as-
            cites drainage of a single patient within a one-month interval overlapped with
            each other and did not form separate clusters (Figure 4d), thus validating the
            robustness of the single-cell DNA sequencing method. Organoid-derived cells over-
            lapped with the same five clusters (albeit with low representation in cluster 3) demon-
            strating both their heterogeneity and resemblance to the original tumor samples (Fig-
            ure 4d). HGS-1-R3 relative cell abundance in cluster 5 (diploid cells) was dramatically
            reduced after extended passaging (passage four versus 12), whereas representation of
            clusters 1, 2 and 4 (aneuploid cells) increased (Figure 4d,e), suggesting that tumor cells
            overgrew normal cells over time, while maintaining tumor heterogeneity.



            Gene expression analysis of OC organoids


            To assess organoid gene expression profiles, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
            on 35 OC organoids, and six normal OSE and FT organoids. Hierarchical clustering as-
            signed organoids to three independent main groups, representing (1) HGS carcinomas,
            (2) MC and END tumors and (3) mainly LGS carcinomas, FT and OSE (Figure 5). Or-
            ganoids derived from multiple tumor lesions of the same patient were transcriptionally
            more similar to each other than to unrelated organoid lines (for example, MC-1.1,2 and
            HGS-3.1,2). In a similar manner, organoids that were sequenced at a second time point
            after extended passaging clustered with their corresponding samples (HGS-1, passage
            eight versus 32; HGS-3.1, passage four versus 32; HGS-1-R2 passage four versus 17). Of
            note, non-malignant MBT and malignant MC organoids clustered together. This was
            seen in eight organoid lines derived from four different patients (two MC and two MBT),
            suggesting a biological link between these samples. This finding is in agreement with a
            causality hypothesis that suggests a stepwise progression from BTs to invasive carcino-
            mas 239–241 . Furthermore, OSE(P)7 organoids (derived from a sample collected during
            risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy) clustered together with OC organoids and apart
            from normal OSE and FT organoid lines. This finding, together with morphological,
            histological and metaphase spread analysis (Extended Data Figure 3e,f), suggested that
            OSE(P)7 consists of malignant cells that were not diagnosed by routine pathological ex-

               Genetic manipulation and drug screening of OC organoids


 2             To demonstrate the experimental potential of OC organoids, we next adapted genetic   2
               manipulation techniques and drug-screening methods for normal FT and OC organ-
               oids. Normal FT organoids were electroporated with pSpCas9(BB)- 2A-GFP plasmid
               into which we cloned a guide RNA targeting the TP53 gene (Extended Data Figure 6a).
               Thus, we could determine the electroporation efficiency by monitoring GFP expression
               (Extended Data Figure 6c,d) and target the TP53 gene, which is believed to be mu-
               tated at an early time point in the course of HGS tumor development. Three days after
               electroporation, nutlin3a (which inhibits MDM2–p53 interaction  and, therefore, kills
                                                                    242
               TP53 wild-type clones) was added to the medium (Extended Data Figure 6a,b). Surviv-
               ing clones were picked, clonally expanded and analyzed for TP53 mutations (Extended
               Data Figure 6e). As a result, multiple clones harboring mutations in TP53 from carriers
               of BRCA germline mutations were established (Extended Data Figure 6f). In a simi-
               lar manner, we have electroporated FT organoids with plasmids targeting both TP53
               and RB1 genes and established clones in which both genes were knocked out (Extended
               Data Figure 6f). Clone expansion was accompanied by morphological alterations in-
               cluding transition from cystic to denser organoids and increased cell shedding into the
               organoid lumen (Extended Data Figure 6g). Hierarchical clustering based on RNA-seq
               assigned the clones into different clusters according to their genetic modifications (Ex-
               tended Data Figure 6h).

            expression data. Read counts were normalized for sequencing depth and the 5,000 most-variable genes were
            used. For three organoid lines, a second time point was analyzed after extended passaging, demonstrating
            high correlation with early passaged organoids. -s, second time point analysis. HGS-1: passage eight and 32;
            HGS-3.2: passage four and 32; HGS-1-R2: passage four and 17. Passage number in which all organoid lines
            were sequenced is given in Supplementary Table 7.
            To demonstrate that OC organoids can be genetically modified in a stable manner, they
            were transduced with a lentiviral vector driving expression of fluorescently tagged his-
            tone-2B (H2B-Neon). H2B-Neon-transduced organoids enabled three-dimensional live
            cell imaging of mitosis and revealed multiple aberrant chromosomal segregation events
            (Supplementary Videos 2–6).
            Next, we tested organoid sensitivity to platinum/taxane drugs that are commonly used
            in OC treatment protocols, that is carboplatin, paclitaxel, as well as non-platinum/taxane
            drugs that previously have been suggested as possible treatments for OC. The drug panel
            included drugs targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (alpelisib, pictilisib, MK2206,
            AZD8055), poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) (Niraparib), the tyrosine kinase Wee1
            (adavosertib) and gemcitabine. Organoids were disrupted into small clumps and dis-

               pensed into 384-well plates pre-coated with BME. A cell viability assay was performed
               5 days after the drugs were added and organoid drug sensitivity was represented by the
                                                                               243
               average area under the dose–response curve (AUC) of two technical replicates . Assay
               quality was confirmed by calculating plate Z-factor across all plates (mean=0.61; Ex-
               tended Data Figure 5e) and by the correlation of AUC between technical and biological
 2             replicates (Pearson correlation=0.94, 0.87, respectively; Extended Data Figure 5c,d).   2


               Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on platinum/taxane drug sensitivity divided
               the organoids into two main clusters: sensitive lines that consisted primarily of HGS or-
               ganoids and resistant lines that consisted primarily of non-HGS organoids (Figure 6b).
               Notably, the HGS-1-R3 line, which was derived from ascites of recurrent disease, clini-
               cally resistant to chemotherapy (Supplementary Table 1), clustered together with the re-
               sistant cluster. HGS-1 line, which was derived from the primary, chemotherapy- sensitive
               tumor of the same patient clustered with the sensitive cluster (Figure 6a,b).


               Since the TP53 gene is mutated in the vast majority of OC, we tested whether nutlin3a
               can serve to rapidly distinguish between wild-type and mutated TP53 OC organoids. In
               total, 16 organoid lines were tested (3 normal FT lines, one genetically modified FT clone
               and 13 OC lines). As expected, all FT organoid lines were highly sensitive to nutlin3a
               treatment whereas the genetically modified clone in which we knocked out the TP53
               gene and the OC lines (with one exception) were resistant (Figure 6c,d). The only OC
               line that was sensitive to nutlin3a, was LGS-1.3 and in this organoid, indeed no point
               mutation in the TP53 gene was identified (Supplementary Table 7).
               Drug-screening assays demonstrated differential drug responses of individual organoid
               lines (Figure 6a–e). For example, HGS-3.1 organoid line was highly sensitive to gemcit-
               abine, adavosertib, carboplatin and paclitaxel and resistant to drugs that target the PI3K/
               AKT/mTOR pathway, whereas HGS-23 line demonstrated the opposite drug sensitivity
               pattern (Figure 6a–d).

               Homologous recombination-deficient cells have been shown to be sensitive to PARP
               inhibitors 244,245 . To determine whether this correlation is also present in OC organoids,
               a subset of organoid lines with differential responses to niraparib (Figure 6e) was test-
               ed for homologous recombination by using the recombination capacity (RECAP) test,
               which assesses homologous recombination capacity using accumulation of RAD51
               protein at sites of DNA double-strand breaks . Organoids were irradiated with 5 Gy

               geminin (a marker for S/G2 phases of the cell cycle). The percentage of geminin+ cells
               with RAD51 foci was scored blinded for sensitivity to niraparib. Organoids with a low
               percentage of geminin+ cells with RAD51 foci were more sensitive to niraparib com-

            pared with organoids with a high percentage of geminin+ cells with RAD51 foci (with
            the exception of MC-2.1) (Figure 6e).



            Xenotransplantation of OC organoids and in vivo drug sensitivity
     2      We next tested whether OC organoids can be orthotopically or subcutaneously trans-                                                                                              2


            planted into immunodeficient mice. For orthotopic transplantations, organoids were
            transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding luciferase and transplanted into the mouse
            bursa. Bioluminescence imaging was used to validate tumor growth (Extended Data
            Figure 5f). All three lines that were orthotopically transplanted grew into a tumor (Sup-
            plementary Table 8). Six out of seven lines were successfully transplanted subcutane-
            ously (Supplementary Table 8). Histological analysis of orthotopically transplanted
            HGS carcinoma organoid line demonstrated that the tumor invaded the ovary, displayed
            prominent nuclear atypia, slit-like spaces and maintained PAX8 and p53 staining (Fig-
            ure 6f and Extended Data 5g). The MC organoid line that was subcutaneously trans-
            planted showed characteristics of a MC tumor including goblet cells and haphazardly
            arranged neoplastic glands lined by columnar cells (Extended Data Figure 5h).


            To validate whether in vitro drug sensitivity is recapitulated in vivo, we chose the HGS-
            3.1 organoid line that was highly sensitive to gemcitabine (Figure 6c), a nucleoside an-
            alog that is in clinical use for HGS OC. Organoids were subcutaneously injected and
            tumor size was monitored. Once it reached 50 mm3, mice were randomly selected and
            treated with vehicle or gemcitabine. While tumors continued growing in vehicle-treated
            mice, tumor growth was completely blocked or reduced in gemcitabine-treated mice,
            as indicated by tumor size measured at the end of the experiment (vehicle and gemcit-
            abine-treated mice, n=9 and n=7, respectively) (Figure 6g).

            Discussion


            Developing reliable experimental models that address clinical challenges, such as early
            detection, tumor recurrence and acquired chemotherapy resistance, is a high priority in
            OC research . In this study, we describe an organoid platform that enables long-term in
                       73
            vitro expansion, manipulation and analysis of a wide variety of OC subtypes. A compre-
            hensive analysis demonstrates that OC organoids maintain tumor histological charac-
            teristics, such as nuclear and cellular atypia, and biomarker expression, such as p53 and
            PAX8. Organoids and corresponding tumors remained highly similar at the genomic
            level, even after extended passaging. Furthermore, organoids recapitulated OC hall-
            marks, such as CNVs, recurrent mutations and tumor heterogeneity. Finally, unsuper-
            vised hierarchical clustering of gene expression data grouped the organoids according
            to their tumor type and demonstrated that LGS organoids are more similar to normal
            samples than are HGS lines.


            During organoid biobanking of normal FT and OSE samples, obtained from risk-reduc-
            ing surgeries, we encountered two samples that were apparently malignant: LGS-2 (clin-
            ically diagnosed) and OSE(P)7 (indicated by organoid characterization, Extended Data
            Figure 3e,f). Interestingly, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression data
            grouped these organoid lines together, thus implying biological similarity. Both organoid
            lines were derived from patients at high risk of developing HGS tumors. Therefore, these
            samples potentially represent an early time point in HGS development. Establishing and

               analyzing additional early/premalignant organoid lines from pBSO material might sub-
               stantiate this hypothesis and provide a unique opportunity to study early HGS tumor
               development.


               An additional experimental platform, recently described to model colorectal cancer de-
 2             velopment 122,123,247,248 , can be established through CRISPR-mediated mutation of tumor   2
               driver genes in normal organoids. Indeed, we demonstrate that normal FT organoids
               from OC high-risk donors can be efficiently CRISPR–Cas9 genome edited and clonally
               expanded afterwards, demonstrating the feasibility of such an approach in OC.

               HGS tumors are frequently sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy, whereas non-
               HGS tumors (such as LGS and MC tumors) are characterized by relative chemoresis-
               tance 249–252 . Consistent with these clinical observations, most HGS organoids were sen-
               sitive to platinum-based treatments, whereas non-HGS organoids (that is MBT, SBT
               and LGS) were more resistant (Figure 6b). In one case, we compared drug responses
               in matched organoid lines derived from primary chemosensitive (HGS-1) and recur-
               rent chemoresistant (HGS-1-R3) tumors of a single patient. This experiment confirmed
               an increased resistance of the organoid line derived from the recurrent tumor to plati-
               num-based chemotherapy, anecdotally substantiating the clinical relevance of OC or-
               ganoids. Increasing the number of matched primary/recurrent organoid pairs is cur-
               rently ongoing. The individual drug responses of OC organoids (for example, compare
               HGS-23-and HGS-3.1) illustrates the complexity of choosing the right treatment. We
               provide proof of concept that in vivo drug sensitivity of OC organoid can be tested fol-
               lowing xenotransplantation.
               In summary, we present a new organoid culture-based platform for the study of OC that
               supports efficient derivation and long-term in vitro expansion of a wide variety of OC
               subtypes. This living OC organoid biobank—available to the research community—
               faithfully recapitulates OC hallmarks, can be subjected to genetic manipulations and to
               drug screening and opens the door to many avenues of OC research.

            OC tissue processing


            On arrival, OC tissues were cut into 3–5 mm  pieces (Extended Data Figure 1a). Two
                                                 3
            or three random pieces were snap frozen and stored at −80 °C for DNA isolation, two
            random pieces were fixed in formalin for histopathological analysis and immunohis-
            tochemistry, and the remainder were processed for organoid derivation. For organoid
            derivation: tissue was minced, washed with 10 ml AdDF+++ (Advanced DMEM/F12
            containing 1x Glutamax, 10 mM HEPES and antibiotics). We let big tissue pieces to
            sink to the tube bottom with gravity (for 2–5 min), collected the supernatant and cen-
            trifuged at 1,000 r.p.m. for 5 min. In case of a visible red pellet, erythrocytes were lysed
            in 2 ml red blood cell lysis buffer (Roche, 11814389001) for 5 min at room temperature
            followed by an additional wash with 10 ml AdDF+++ and centrifugation at 1,000 r.p.m.
            Remaining big tissue pieces were digested in 5–10 ml AdDF+++ supplemented with 5
            μM RHO/ROCK pathway inhibitor (Abmole Bioscience, Y-27632) containing 0.5–1.0
                  −1
            mg ml  collagenase (Sigma, C9407) on an orbital shaker at 37 °C for 0.5–1.0 h. The di-
            gested tissue suspension was sheared using 5 ml plastic pipettes. Suspension was strained
            over a 100 μm filter and large tissue pieces entered a subsequent digestion and shearing
            step. Suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 r.p.m. and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml
            AdDF+++ and centrifuged again at 1,000 r.p.m. Once again, in case of a visible red pellet,
            erythrocytes were lysed in 2 ml red blood cell lysis buffer for 5 min at room temperature
            followed by an additional wash with 10 ml AdDF+++ and centrifugation at 1,000 r.p.m.
            Ascites/pleural effusion samples were centrifuged at 1,000 r.p.m. and treated with 2 ml
            red blood cell lysis buffer for 5 min at room temperature. Following erythrocyte lysis,
            10 ml AdDF+++ was added and suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 r.p.m. Following
            removal of a large part of the ovarian stroma and the surrounding muscle layers of FT,
            ovary and FT samples were processed as above.

               °C for 30 min. On BME stabilization, 500 ml of appropriate organoid medium (OC/
               OCwnt/OSE/FT medium, see Supplementary Table 2) was added and plates trans-
                                                                          −1
               ferred to humidified 37 °C/5% CO2 incubators. In some cases, 25 ng ml  HGF (Pepro-
               tech) was added to the medium (Supplementary Table 3). Medium was changed every
               3–4 d and organoids were passaged every 1–4 weeks. Organoid passaging: organoids
 2             were mechanically sheared through P1000 pipet tip connected to P200 pipet tip without   2
               a filter. Dense organoids that were not easily sheared mechanically were collected with
               1 ml pre-warmed (37 °C) Accutase solution (A6964, Sigma), incubated for 1–5 min at
               room temperature and mechanically sheared as before. Following the addition of 10 ml
               AdDF+++ and centrifugation at 1,200 r.p.m, organoid fragments were resuspended in
               cold BME and reseeded as above at suitable ratios (1:1 to 1:4) allowing the formation of
               new organoids. In some lines, organoids repeatedly appeared floating in medium. These
               organoid lines could be transferred to repellent plates (Greiner, 662970) and expanded
               with medium containing 5% BME (Supplementary Table 3). Genetically manipulated
               FT clones were expanded in OCwnt medium.

               Scanning electron microscopy


               To remove BME, organoids were collected with Cell Recovery Solution (Corning) and
               gently shacked using tube rotator, for 30 min at 4 °C. Organoids were allowed to settle
               down with gravity, the recovery solution was removed and 1 ml of 1% (v/v) glutaralde-
               hyde (Sigma) in PBS was added. Following an overnight fixation at 4 °C, organoids were
               transferred onto 12 mm poly-l-lysine coated coverslips (Corning). The organoids were
               serially dehydrated by consecutive 10 min incubations in 2 ml of 10% (v/v), 25% (v/v)
               and 50% (v/v) ethanol-PBS, 75% (v/v) and 90% (v/v) ethanol-H2O (2x) followed by 50%
               ethanol hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and 100% HMDS (Sigma). Coverslips were re-
               moved from the 100% HMDS, air dried overnight at room temperature and mounted
               onto 12 mm specimen stubs (Agar Scientific). Following gold coating to 1 nm using a
               Q150R sputter coater (Quorum Technologies) at 20 mA, samples were examined with a
               Phenom PRO table-top scanning electron microscope (Phenom-World).

               Tissue and organoids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by dehydration,
               paraffin embedding, sectioning and standard HE staining. For the blind test, sections
               were randomized and analyzed by an OC pathologist. Immunohistochemistry was per-
               formed using antibodies as specified in Supplementary Table 9. Images were acquired
               on a Leica Eclipse E600 microscope and processed using the Adobe Creative Cloud soft-

     2      were taken at 4 min intervals.                                                                                                                                                  2



            Genomic analysis



            For karyotyping, 0.1 μg ml  colcemid (Gibco, 15212012) was added to the complete
                                   −1
            growth medium. About 12 h later organoids were harvested, trypsinized into single cells,
            incubated in hypotonic 75 mM KCl solution for 10 min and fixed in methanol:acetic
            acid solution (3:1). Metaphase spreads were prepared, mounted with DAPI-containing
            Vectashield, imaged on a DM6000 Leica microscope and quantified by manual chromo-
            some counting. A minimum of 14 spreads was analyzed for each line. For DNA isolation,
            library preparation and WGS, organoid and blood samples were processed by using the
            DNeasy Qiagen kit. DNA from tumor tissue was isolated with the Genomic Tip Qiagen
            kit, supplemented with RNase treatment. Quality and quantity of samples were checked
            with Qubit (DNA BR). DNA integrity and RNA contamination was assessed by using
            Tapestation DNA screens (Genomic screen) and Nanodrop (260/280 ratio). Per sample,
            500–1,000 ng of DNA was used for DNA library preparation, and whole-genome paired-
            end sequencing (2x150 bp) was performed on Illumina HiSeq X Ten and NovaSeq 6000
            to an average coverage of 42x. Supplementary Table 10 provides a list of all commercial
            and custom code used for data collection and analysis including: name, version, source
            and link. WGS data were processed using our in-house Illumina Analysis Pipeline (IAP)
            v. 2.5.1 (https://github.com/UMCUGenetics/IAP). Briefly, reads were mapped against
            the human reference genome GRCh37 using Burrows–Wheeler Alignment with maxi-
            mal exact matches (BWA-MEM), v. 0.7.5a-r405 . Read mapping was followed by mark-

               SNVs that were only detected in either the tumor or the organoid sample of a pair were
               called in the corresponding sample (tumor or organoid) when supported by more than
               5% of the reads covering that position. CNV was detected for each sample independently

               using Control-FREEC, v. 7.2  and assuming a ploidy of 2. For sample HGS-6, a ploidy
               of 3 was assumed for the plots. Structural variation calling was performed using Manta,
 2             v.0.29.5 . For increased sensitivity, we ran Manta in the four available analysis types:   2
                     262
               singlesample, multi-sample, tumor-only and tumor-normal. When comparing SVs
               called in one of the tumor/organoid pairs with the matching sample, we inspected the
               output of the tumor-normal mode of the pertinent tumor/organoid sample with the re-
               sults of the four calling modes for the matching tumor/organoid sample. Somatic variant
               calling could not be performed for samples without matching reference DNA (CCC-1
               and END-1). In these cases, germline variant calling was performed jointly for tumor
                                                                   255

               SV calling of the CCC-1 and END-1 samples, the tumor-normal mode of Manta could
               not be used, but all other Manta variant calling workflows were performed (tumor-only,
               singlesample, multi-sample). To enrich for somatic SVs, only SVs larger than 10 Kb and
               not found in the GoNL or 1000 Genomes studies were considered for these two samples.


               Single-cell WGS library preparation


               Cells were sorted into 384-well plates with 5 μl of mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich). After

               Five-hundred nanoliters of Restriction Enzyme mix (1 U μl–1 NLAIII in NEB Cutsmart

               DNA Ligase in 1x T4 DNA Ligase buffer supplemented with 3 mM ATP) was added to
               each well and ligation was performed overnight at 16 °C. After ligation, single cells were
               pooled and library preparation was performed as described in Muraro et al. . Libraries
                                                                            265

               Reads were aligned to GRCh38 using Burrows– Wheeler Aligner v0.7.14 mapping tool
               with settings ‘bwa mem –M’ . Data were binned in 1 MB bins and normalized to the

            expected NLAIII mappability per bin. The expected NLAIII mappability per bin was
            calculated by generating 108 reads from the reference genome, with every read starting
            at a NLAIII site. These reads were subsequently mapped and binned using the same
            procedure as for the experimental data. The number of reads per bin was then divided by
            the average number of reads per bin to acquire the expected NLAIII mappability for each
     2      bin. Regions where the expected NLAIII mappability was <0.9 or >1.2 were excluded                                                                                               2
            from further analysis. After this the cells were filtered and only cells with >20,000 reads
            were kept for further analysis. The median read count of each cell was then set to 2 to
            represent a diploid genome. Data were log2 transformed to obtain log2 CN ratios and
            smoothed using a running mean (R package caTools) with a width of 20 MB. To remove
            additional low-quality cells, the variance across the genome was calculated for each cell
            and cells with a variance >0.3 were removed. For two dimensional visualization of the
            data, we first performed independent component analysis (ICA) (R package fastICA)
            followed by t-stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) (R package Rtsne). Clustering
            was performed using ward.D2 hierarchical clustering on the Manhattan distances of the
            ICA-transformed data. Subsequently, the average copy number profile per cluster was
            calculated using the R package DNAcopy. Finally, a tree was constructed using ward.
            D2 hierarchical clustering on the manhattan distances of the DNAcopy-derived CNV
            profiles of the non-diploid clusters.

            RNA-seq analysis


            RNA was isolated from organoids with Trizol Reagent (Ambion). RNA libraries were
            generated with the Truseq Stranded Ribo-zero Sample preparation kit. RNA integrity
            was assessed by Tapestation (RNA screen) and quantified by Qubit (RNA). Libraries were
            multiplexed and paired-end sequenced (2 x 75 bp) on Illumina NextSeq. Supplementary
            Table 10 provides a list of all commercial and custom code used for data collection and
            analysis including: name, version, source and link. RNA-seq data were processed with our
            in-house RNA analysis pipeline (v.2.3.0, https://github.com/UMCUGenetics/RNASeq).
            Reads were aligned to the human reference genome GRCh37 using STAR v. 2.4.2 ,
                                                                                 267

            definitions GRCh37, release 74) with zero read counts were filtered out (21,711 features
            out of 63,677). Gene symbols were mapped to the ENSEMBL features using the biomaRt
            package v. 2.26.1 , and features without corresponding gene symbols and with duplicate
                          269
            mappings were removed. The final count matrix consisted of 30,080 rows (genes). The
            DESeq2 package, v1.10.1  was then used to normalize the read counts using the
                                  270
            median-of-ratios method. Spearman correlation between samples was calculated
            using the normalized read counts from all 5,000 most variable genes and samples were
            clustered using hierarchical clustering with complete linkage on the correlation matrix.
            The genetically modified organoid lines were analyzed using the same DESeq2 pipeline.

               hybridized to the Infinium MethylationEPIC 850 K BeadChip (Illumina) to analyze the
               genome-wide methylation status of 865,859 methylation sites. Supplementary Table 10
               provides a list of all commercial and custom code used for data collection and analysis
               including: name, version, source and link. For methylation data analysis, fluorescence
               intensity data (.IDAT) files were analyzed by using the minfi R package . Beta-values

               Following electroporation, 300 μl of complete growth medium was added to the cells and
               they were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were centrifuged, suspended
               in 200 μl BME and plated as previously described. Complete medium was added after
               cell BME suspension drops had solidified. Two to three days after electroporation,
               10 μM nutlin-3 (Cayman Chemical) was added to the growth medium. Two to three
               weeks after electroporation, single organoids were picked and transferred into 1.5 ml
               microcentrifuge tubes containing 200 μl of pre-warmed Accutase. Following 2–3 min
               incubation, organoids were sheared into small cell clumps by pipetting, washed with 1

            in a randomized manner and DMSO end concentration was 1% in all wells. 120 h after
            adding the drugs, ATP levels were measured using the Cell-Titer Glo2.0 (Promega BV)
            according to the manufacturer’s instructions and luminescence was measured using a
            SpectraMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Results were normalized to vehicle
            (DMSO=100%) and baseline control (navitoclax 20  μM). Data were analyzed using
            GraphPad Prism 6. Using the trapezoid rule for numerical integration, the AUC was
            approximated between the lowest and highest concentrations screened in the actual assay.
            Organoid drug sensitivity was represented by the average AUC of two technical replicates
            and independent experimental repetitions in a subset of treatments and visualized using
            RStudio. Experimental repetition with a subset of drugs was performed in the following

            3.2, HGS-22,  HGS-23. Euclidean distance between  samples was measured using the
            normalized (row Z-score) AUC. Alpelisib (BYL719), catalog no. S2814, Selleckchem;

               RECAP assay


               Organoids were incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2 humidified atmosphere and an equal number
               of organoids were transferred to 3 cm Petri dishes containing 2 ml of medium. One petri
 2             dish was irradiated with 5 Gy X-rays (200 kV, 4 mA, YXLON Y.TU 225-D02) and the   2

               other Petri dish was mock-treated (that is not irradiated). EdU (0.02 mM; ThermoFisher
               Scientific, Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Imaging Kit, catalog no. C10340) was added
               to the organoids and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C/5% CO2 humidified atmosphere on a
               60 r.p.m. rotating platform. The organoids were transferred to 15 ml falcon tubes and
               after the organoids were settled down by normal gravity at room temperature, medium
               was removed and replaced by 10 ml buffered formalin (10%). Organoids were fixed
               for 1 h on a rotating device at room temperature, washed twice with PBS and stored
               in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. The organoids were embedded into paraffin, sliced into 5 μm
               slices and incubated in 60 °C o/n on StarFrost microscope slides (76 x 26 mm, Knittel
               glass). Immunofluorescence staining was performed to stain for DAPI (ThermoFisher
               Scientific, catalog no. P36935,), geminin (primary antibody rabbit, Proteintech Europe,
               catalog no. 10802-1-AP), RAD51 (primary antibody mouse, Gene Tex, GTX70230) and
               EdU (ThermoFisher Scientific, Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Imaging Kit, catalog no.
               C10340). RAD51 foci were scored blindly in 10 randomly chosen organoids, counting at
               least 100 geminin+ cells in total for both the irradiated and the non-irradiated organoids.
               Biological repetitions were done as indicated in figure legend (Figure 6). A nucleus was
               scored as RAD51 positive if it contained more than five foci. Organoids in which less
               than six cells were counted as geminin+ were filtered out from the analysis.

               Cancer Institute (AVD3010020172464; IVD 9.1 EGP 8102) 8102). Ovarian injection:
               mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% induction, and 2% maintenance) and a
               small incision in the flank and peritoneum was made. The ovarium was gently taken
               from the abdominal cavity and tumor cells are slowly injected with an insulin needle
               (Terumo 29 G x 1/2, 0.33 x 12 mm) into the bursa. The ovarium was positioned back in
               the abdominal cavity, and peritoneum and skin were sutured separately. IVIS-imaging:
               mice were injected with 10 μ1 per g body weight of Beetle luciferin (promega E1605)
               and after 10 min bioluminescence was measured on the IVIS Lumina. After the mice
               were killed, the ovarium was taken out and embedded in paraffin for further analysis.

            Intervention study: experiments on NSG mice were carried out at the Netherlands
            Cancer Institute according to local and international regulations and ethical guidelines,
            and were approved by the local animal experimental committee at the Netherlands
            Cancer Institute (AVD301002015407; IVD 1.1 EGP 8583). Subcutaneous injection:
            mice are subcutaneously injected with the organoid lines. Caliper measurements were
     2      performed three times per week. When the tumors reached a size of 50 mm3, treatment                                                                                             2
            started with either Vehicle (saline) or Gemcitabine (2 mg kg), intraperitoneal injection
            5 times per week (5 on, 2 off) for 4 consecutive weeks. Ten mice per treatment arm were
            included. Tumor size was monitored for 55 d; mice that died before that time point (after
            surgery or gemcitabine treatment) were excluded from the analysis.

            Statistical analyses


            Where applicable, statistical methods are outlined in the respective figure legends.
            Statistical analysis was performed utilizing Microsoft Excel, GraphPad and R package.
            P values were calculated using a two-tailed Student’s t-test. DNA and RNA sequencing
            analysis  details  can  be  found  in  the  relevant  Methods  sections.  For  karyotyping  a
            minimum of 14 metaphase spreads was analyzed for each line. For single-cell DNA
            analysis 791 cells from 2 recurrent tumor samples and 3 corresponding organoid lines
            were analyzed. Drug screen killing curves show the average ± s.e.m. of two technical
            replicates. AUC of independent drug screen repetitions was averaged and presented in a
            drug sensitivity heat map (experimental repetitions (n=2) at different passage numbers
            in a subset of treatments was carried out in 11 independent organoid lines, Extended
            Data Figure 5d). For animal intervention experiments, 10 mice per treatment arm were
            included. Mice that died before the experimental end-point were excluded from analysis.
            In the case of representative results, the number of independent organoid lines or
            experimental repetitions and their relevant description are indicated in the figure legend.

               (n=22) displayed cystic morphology. (B) Representative SEM image showing ciliated cells facing FT organ-
               oid lumen. Scale bar, 50 μm. SEM was performed on one FT organoid line. (C) Histological analysis of FT
               organoids demonstrating H&E, Ki67, PAX8 and Ac-α-tubb staining. Histological analysis was performed
               on three independent FT organoid lines with similar results. Scale bar, 100 μm. (D) An overview image of
               normal OSE organoids embedded in 40 μl BME drops displaying cystic morphology (top left image). Seven
               out of eight OSE organoid lines that were established displayed cystic morphology. OSE organoid images of
               H&E, Ki67 and cytokeratin 8 (CK8) staining, demonstrating a cystic morphology of proliferative epithelial
               cells. Histological analysis was performed on two independent OSE organoid lines with similar results. Scale
               bar, 100 μm. (E) First row: bright-field images of LGS-2.2 (left) and OSE(P)7 (right) organoid lines. Unlike
               normal FT and OSE that display cystic morphology both lines show dense phenotype. OSE(P)7 is the only
               OSE organoid line that displays dense phenotype. Scale bar, 200 μm. Second to last rows: histological and
               immunohistochemical images demonstrate that organoids are positively stained for PAX8 and WT1, mark-
               ers of OC serous subtypes. Organoids display reduced cellular organization in comparison to normal FT and
               OSE organoids. Scale bar, 100 μm. (F) Scatter plot presenting metaphase spread analysis and mean for each
               line. Both lines present aneuploidy.

               showed nice recovery following electroporation (top), whereas the growth of organoids electroporated in a
               similar manner was dramatically inhibited when nutlin3a was added (middle). Surviving clones that are not
               inhibited by nutlin3a treatment are visible only when organoids were electroporated with a vector containing
               TP53 gRNA (bottom). Four independent electroporation experiments followed by nutlin3A treatment were
               conducted giving rise to multiple nutlin3A resistant clones. (C) A representative flow cytometry analysis
               of organoids 48 h following electroporation demonstrating 25% of the cell express GFP. Summary of six
               independent repetitions of this experiment are presented in d. (D) Box-and-whisker plot (minimum to
 2             maximum) showing the percentage of GFP positive cells following electroporation. Horizontal bars and   2
               dashed horizontal bars represent median and mean of all dots, respectively. Mean ± s.d.=23.8 ± 5.5%,
               median=25.5%. Six independent experiments that were conducted with three different FT organoid lines
               are presented, demonstrating high and robust electroporation efficiency. (E) An example of CRISPR–Cas9
               mediated editing of TP53 gene in FT organoids. Targeted locus is presented and gRNA (solid line), PAM
               sequence (red highlight) and cut point (arrow head) are indicated. Sequencing results revealed out-of-frame
               deletions induced by CRISPR–Cas9 editing. (F) Table presenting six FT genetically engineered clones derived
               from two independent donors (FT(P)1 and FT(P)2). For each clone, targeted gene description (in both TP53
               and RB1 genes) including HGVS nomenclature is presented. (HET, heterozygous; HOM, homozygous). (G)
               BF images (top) and H&E staining (bottom) of four independent clones show deviation from cystic and
               well-organized normal FT organoid morphology. Passage number is indicated. This analysis was conducted
               on three independent TP clones (loss-of-function mutations in the TP53 gene) and three independent
               TPR clones (loss-of-function mutations in the TP53 and RB1 genes) with similar results. (H) Heat map of
               Spearman correlation values of three independent normal FT organoid lines (derived from different donors)
               and genetically engineered clones (n=3 independent TP clones (loss-of-function mutations in the TP53
               gene) and 3 independent TPR clones (loss-of-function mutations in the TP53 and RB1 genes)), using RNA-
               seq expression data. Read counts were normalized for sequencing depth and the 1,000 most-variable genes
               were used. Clones were assigned into different groups according to their mutational profile.

               Abstract



               There remains an unmet need for preclinical models to enable personalized therapy
               for ovarian cancer (OC) patients. Here, we evaluate the capacity of patient-derived
               organoids (PDOs) to predict clinical drug response and functional consequences of
               tumor heterogeneity. We included 36 whole-genome characterized PDOs from 23 OC
               patients with known clinical histories. OC PDOs maintain genomic features of the
               original tumor lesion and recapitulate patient response to neoadjuvant carboplatin/
 3             paclitaxel combination treatment. PDOs display inter- and intrapatient drug response   3

               heterogeneity to chemotherapy and targeted drugs, which can partially be explained by
               genetic aberrations. PDO drug screening identifies high responsiveness to at least one
               drug for 88% of patients. PDOs are valuable preclinical models that can provide insights
               in drug response for individual patients with OC, complementary to genetic testing.
               Generating PDOs of multiple tumor locations can improve clinical decision making and
               increase our knowledge on genetic and drug response heterogeneity.

            Introduction



            Epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) is characterized by the development of chemotherapy
            resistance and poor survival. Overall survival for patients with OC has only slightly im-
            proved over the past decades, despite developments in the field such as optimized surgical
            tumor resection, administration of (hyperthermic) intraperitoneal chemotherapy and
            introduction of targeted treatments such as PARP-inhibitors . While most patients with
                                                             274
            OC respond well to initial treatment, the majority will develop recurrent disease with-
     3      in the first two years and become resistant to chemotherapy. In the setting of recurrent                                                                                        3
            disease, a wide range of chemotherapeutic and targeted drugs is available. PARP-inhibi-
            tors are indicated for patients who experienced complete or partial response to previous
                                                               275
            platinum treatment, irrespective of BRCA1/2-mutation status . Still, BRCA1/2-muta-
            tion carriers experience more benefit from PARP-inhibition compared to patients with
                                                       275
            homologous recombination (HR)-proficient tumors . However, for the majority of re-
            lapsed patients and drugs, no genetic markers are available to predict response. These
            patients might benefit from patient-derived model systems that can be employed to test
            response to drugs prior to treatment in the clinic.


            Traditionally, OC drug response has been studied in 2D-cell lines and xenografts. 2D-cell
            lines offer a relatively cheap and quick model system, suitable for high-throughput drug
            screening; while patient-derived xenografts offer the potential to study tumor drug re-
            sponse in a living organism, but are not suitable for high-throughput drug screening
                      276
            experiments . In the past decade patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have been estab-
                 277
            lished , a 3D-cell culture model system that maintains cellular heterogeneity of healthy
            tissues and tumors. Recently, PDOs of OC were established which represent the genom-
            ic features of the original tumors 278–280 . Furthermore, a drug screening comparison be-
            tween 2D-cultures and PDOs of OC revealed that cytostatic drug efficacy was dependent
            on the employed culture system; PDO drug responses correlated better with genomic
                                               280
            aberrations compared to 2D-cell cultures . To employ the organoid system to guide
            treatment choice in the clinic, it is vital that the correlation between PDO drug response
            and clinical drug response is established. To this extent, prospective clinical trials have
            been performed with PDOs of patients with colorectal cancer, in which in vitro drug
            screening recapitulated patient response to chemotherapy and targeted drugs 138,281 . For
            OC, we and others previously provided anecdotal evidence on the correlation between
            clinical and PDO drug response 278,279,282 , but direct comparisons are still limited.

            When predicting treatment response, genetic heterogeneity should be considered. Ep-
            ithelial OC, especially the high-grade serous subtype, is a heterogeneous disease with
            widespread inter- and intrapatient genetic heterogeneity 78,283 . A virtue of the PDO model

               system is the possibility to study genetic and phenotypic tumor heterogeneity .
               In this study, we systematically assessed if in vitro drug response of OC PDOs correlates
               to patients’ clinical response to chemotherapeutics. We studied inter- and intrapatient
               drug response heterogeneity to a wide range of chemotherapeutics as well as targeted
               drugs, and linked differential drug response to genetic variation.

               Results
               PDOs can be (rapidly) established from different OC subtypes
 3                                                                                          3


               In total, we included 36 PDOs (of which 29 were established previously ), derived from
                                                                        278
               23 patients with different histological subtypes of OC who underwent primary or inter-
               val debulking surgery or ascites drainage (Table S1). PDO sample names are informative
               of histological subtype as well as patient (first number) and tumor location (second num-
               ber). We have previously demonstrated that PDOs are largely similar to the carcinoma
               fields within their matching tumor, based on histopathological assessment . The major-
                                                                           278
               ity of PDOs in our biobank were thoroughly characterized by whole-genome sequencing
               and histopathological examination and biobanked prior to drug testing, to establish a re-
               liable platform. This resulted in a considerable length of time from PDO establishment to
               drug screening. However, in order to incorporate PDO-based drug response prediction
               in clinical care, PDO establishment and screening must be executed within a short time
               span. As a pilot experiment, we successfully established and rapidly screened organoids
               from a patient with recurrent disease (HG-26; Figure S1A-C). Within 20 days of tumor
               collection the response to six therapies became available.



               PDOs retained genomic features of the original tumor lesion



               We characterized 36 organoids, 30 matching tumors and 31 germline samples by
               whole-genome sequencing to an average coverage of 32X. Passage numbers at which
               PDOs were sequenced are provided in Table S1. First, we compared the genomic profiles
               of PDOs and the tumors they were derived from. An average of 8,290 and 10,358 SNVs
               were identified in the parental tumor specimen and their matched PDO, respectively. On
               average 67% of variants were shared between the tumor and PDO, 6% of the SNVs were
               unique to the tumor, and 27% to the PDO (Figure S2A). Assessment of CNAs demon-
               strated comparable copy-number states in the majority of pairs (Figure S2B-C). HGS-
               3.1, LGS-2.2 and MC-2.1 presented with a much higher number of SNVs than their
               matched tumor specimen and considerable CNA dissimilarities within PDO-tumor
               pairs. These exceptions are likely due to a high degree of normal cell contamination in

            the tumor samples, which was confirmed by PURPLE, a purity ploidy estimator (Table
            S7) . In general, based on PURPLE tumor content estimates (Table S7), PDOs are en-
               284
            riched for tumor cells, whereas tumor samples are heterogeneous, representing a mix of
            tumor cells and normal cells. For tumor samples with tumor content, PDOs retained the
            genomic features of the original tumor lesions.


            PDO drug response correlates to patients’ clinical response
     3      Next, we evaluated the potential of PDOs to reflect patients’ drug response to chemother-                                                                                       3


            apy. For this we selected all PDOs that were derived at interval debulking surgery from
            patients with high grade serous (HGS) OC, with known clinical histories (Table S1 (clin-
            ical comparison) and S2). Seven PDOs (derived from five patients) were exposed to car-
            boplatin and paclitaxel combination treatment in vitro and we could directly compare
            their response to the patient’s clinical response. Related samples HGS-3.1 and HGS-3.2
            were most responsive to carboplatin and paclitaxel combination treatment (AUC=0.37
            and 0.29), while HGS-24 was the least responsive (AUC=0.88) (Figure 1). These PDO
            drug responses showed a statistically significant correlation (p<0.01) with clinical re-
            sponse as measured by histopathological (chemotherapy response score (CRS)), bio-
            chemical (normalization of serum biomarker CA-125) and radiological (RECIST) re-
            sponses (Figure 1; Figure S1D-H). The derivation of organoids upon interval debulking
            was restricted to CRS1 and CRS2 scored samples and therefore a high-risk subgroup of
            patients, as CRS3 scored samples will not have macroscopic tumor lesions from which
            the pathologist can provide tissue for organoid derivation. PDOs derived from tumor lo-
            cations with no or minimal histopathological response (CRS=1) were less responsive to
            carboplatin and paclitaxel combination treatment compared to PDOs derived from tu-
            mor locations with appreciable pathological response (CRS=2) (p=5.821e-05, Wilcoxon
            signed-rank test) . Biochemically, clinical drug response is measured according to the
                          285
            response criteria and timing of normalization of CA-125 286,287 . Even though all patients
            exhibited CA-125 response during primary treatment, PDOs derived from patients who
            did not reach CA-125 normalization during primary treatment were less responsive to
            the chemotherapeutics compared to PDOs from the patient in whom CA-125 levels

            RECIST criteria (version 1.1) , comparing imaging data at initiation of chemotherapy
                                    287
            to imaging data prior to interval debulking based on CT-scanning. PDOs derived from
            patients with RECIST stable disease were less responsive to carboplatin and paclitaxel
            combination treatment compared to PDOs from patients with RECIST partial response
            (p=0.0092). To compare long-term clinical response to PDO response, recurrence and
            survival were assessed. All patients experienced recurrent disease within four to 14

            and targeted drugs. Drugs were selected based on clinical practice or evaluation in clinical
            trials for ovarian cancer or solid tumors in general. Drug response experiments were
            performed in technical replicates and replicate AUC values highly correlated (R²=0.87)
            (Figure S3A). Passage numbers at which PDOs were screened for drug response are
            provided in Table S1. PDOs were classified into a low-responsive subgroup if the drug
            concentration that reduced viability of >50% of cells (IC50-value) was higher than the
            concentration achievable in patient plasma (concentration steady state, maximum
            concentration (Css/Cmax; Table S3) 288,289 , and a high-responsive subgroup if the IC50-
     3      value was lower than the Css/Cmax.                                                                                                                                              3
            Divergent responses were observed to chemotherapeutic drugs carboplatin (platinum/
            alkylating agent), paclitaxel (taxane/antimicrotubule agent) and gemcitabine (pyrimi-
            dine antagonist) (Figure 2A-C; Table S3). A minority of PDOs was classified into the
            high-responsive subgroup of carboplatin (7/31, 23%) and paclitaxel monotherapy (5/31,
            16%), while most PDOs (29/35, 83%) were in the high-responsive subgroup of gemcit-
            abine. Response also correlated with OC histological subtype, all LGS-samples showed
            low responsiveness to paclitaxel and carboplatin monotherapy (except for response to
            carboplatin in LGS-3.1), while the high responsiveness was restricted to HG(S)-sam-
            ples. For certain PDOs, combination treatment with two chemotherapeutic drugs had a
            greater effect on viability (lower IC50 values) than the drugs’ individual effects (Table S3)
            indicating either an additive or synergistic effect of the combined drugs. Our results, for
            example, showed that carboplatin and paclitaxel treatment alone had minimal effect on
            LGS-3.1 with an IC50-value of 1.46 and >2.5 log μM, respectively, while the IC50-value
            of carboplatin and paclitaxel was reduced to 0.56 and -0.34 log μM in the combination
            treatment.

               their HR-proficient genetic make-up (no biallelic hit in HR-related genes). Not evaluated = no CHORD
               evaluation due to missing normal reference. G-J. Response to targeted drugs afatinib (G), vemurafenib (H),
               flavopiridol (I) and adavosertib (J) could partly be explained by genetic aberrations (color-coded) (Table S6,
               S7). WT=wildtype for the genes mentioned in each panel. NR=IC50-value not reached

               The responses to targeted drugs revealed differences and similarities between PDOs
               which in part correlated to their genetic makeup. For example, all PDOs were classified
               in the low-responsive subgroup of the PARP-inhibitors olaparib, niraparib, and rucapa-
               rib (Figure 2D-F), consistent with the absence of biallelic inactivation of BRCA1 and
               BRCA2, and other genes involved in homologous recombination (e.g. CHEK2, FAN-
               CA, PALB2, RAD50, RAD51(B/C/D); Table S6 and S7). Additionally, HR-classifier
               CHORD classified all samples as HR-proficient based on genome-wide somatic muta-
               tion contexts (Table S7) . As expected, BRAF-, KRAS-, and NRAS-mutant PDOs were
                                  290
               classified in the low-responsive subgroup of pan-HER-inhibitor afatinib (12/25; Figure
               2G) and high-responsive subgroup of BRAF-inhibitor vemurafenib (5/7; Figure 2H).

            piridol, were present in our cohort 291–293 . CDKN2A was affected in the two PDOs which
            were the least responsive to flavopiridol: MBT-2.1 showed loss of both alleles and END-
            1.1 harbored a nonsense variant (p.(R58*); Figure 2I), while copy number loss of XIAP
            was observed in two of the flavopiridol high-responsive PDOs (Figure 2I). All TP53
            wildtype PDOs (N=7) were classified into the low-responsive subgroup of WEE1-inhib-
            itor adavosertib, while TP53 mutants (N=15) were distributed among both the low- and
            high-responsive PDOs (Figure 2J). For the remaining drugs, alpelisib, AZD-8055, MK-
            2206, and pictilisib, no known genotype and drug response phenotype correlations were
     3      observed.                                                                                                                                                                       3
            Subsequently, we evaluated for each individual patient how many of the tested mono-
            therapies (3-13 per patient) remained as potential treatments based on an IC50-value
            smaller than the achievable concentration in patient plasma (Css/Cmax). In case of mul-

               PDOs derived from individual patients revealed intrapatient drug response
               heterogeneity


               In addition to assessing interpatient drug response heterogeneity, we examined intra-
               patient drug response heterogeneity. For seven individual patients, two to four PDOs
               were derived from distinct cancer lesions at a single time point. For one additional pa-
               tient, three PDOs were derived at subsequent time points (Table S1, heterogeneity com-
               parison). To set a threshold for differential drug response, we first assessed the extent of
 3             biological variability. We observed low drug response variability across biological repli-  3
               cates (N=84) with an IC50-value correlation coefficient of R²=0.82 and mean IC50-fold
               change of 2.5±1.5 (range=1.0-7.3) (Figure S3B-C; Table S4), therefore, a ten-fold change
               in IC50-value was chosen as a stringent cut-off for differential drug response.


               While homogeneous responses were observed to a subset of drugs and drug combina-
               tions; carboplatin combined with gemcitabine, adavosertib, or olaparib, carboplatin,
               olaparib, niraparib, rucaparib, alpelisib, AZD-8055, flavopiridol, pictilisib, and vemu-
               rafenib (Figure S4), all related PDOs exhibited differential drug response to at least one
               drug, as defined by a >10-fold change in IC50-value (Figure 4). In the seven patients
               of whom multiple PDOs were derived at the same time point, differential response to
               mono-treatment was observed 11/36 times (31%). Importantly, in six cases, one of the
               samples exhibited high responsiveness whereas a related sample exhibited low respon-
               siveness to the tested drugs.


               To examine the impact of intratumor genetic heterogeneity on phenotypic heterogeneity,
               we assessed genetic variants in genes that are known or predicted to interact with drugs
               according to the drug-gene interaction database resource (DGIdb; Table S5) . HGS-
                                                                              291
               13.3, LGS-2.2, LGS-5.2, MC-3.1 and MC-3.2 PDOs were markedly less responsive to
               the pan-HER-inhibitor afatinib compared to their related PDOs, while differences in re-
               sponse could not be explained by differences in copy number of EGFR/ERBB2(HER2)/
               ERBB3/ERBB4 (Figure 4F, Table S7). Despite meeting the criteria of differential re-
               sponse, all four BRAF-mutant LGS-5 PDOs were classified in the low-responsive sub-
               group of afatinib with an IC50-value above the steady state concentration of -0.8 log
               μM. The remaining related PDOs with differential response (HGS-13, LGS-2, MC-3)
               were classified in both the low- and high-responsive subgroup of afatinib. We observed
               differences in KRAS mutation status between the four PDOs derived from a patient
               with a mucinous OC (MC-3). The two least responsive PDOs (MC-3.1 and MC-3.2)
               harbored a KRAS hotspot mutation (p.G12V), whereas the other low-responsive PDO
               MC-3.4 harbored two different KRAS mutations (p.L19F and p.Q61E, both reported
               to have an attenuated phenotype compared to hotspot mutations 294,295  and the high-re-

            sponsive PDO MC-3.3 was KRAS wildtype (WT) (Table S6). KRAS mutations were
            independently confirmed with Sanger sequencing (Figure S3C).


            LGS-5 PDOs also exhibited differential responsiveness to gemcitabine and the MEK-in-
            hibitor cobimetinib (Figure 4B, 4G). LGS-5.1 and LGS-5.2 were both in the low-respon-
            sive subgroup of gemcitabine, whereas LGS-5.3 and LGS-5.4 were in the high-respon-
            sive subgroup. LGS-5.4 was also highly responsive to cobimetinib, while the other LGS-5
            PDOs were in the low-responsive subgroup. All LGS-5 PDOs were largely genetically
     3      identical, and no variants or copy number changes were identified that explained differ-                                                                                        3
            ential response to these drugs (Table S6, S7).


            HGS-13.3 PDOs revealed a >10-fold higher IC50-value compared to HGS-13.4 PDOs
            for gemcitabine, the combined carboplatin and paclitaxel treatment and afatinib (Figure
            4B, 4C, 4F, Table S3). Consistent with previous findings on the effect of copper-efflux
            pumps on chemotherapy sensitivity 296–298 , copy number losses of ATP7A and ATP7B
            were identified in the HGS-13.4 (Table S7). Additionally, six other genes previously
            associated with chemotherapy response (EIF4EBP1, EDNRB, NAT2, TLE3, BRCA2
            and NRG1) 299–301 , exhibited different copy-number states between HGS-13.3 and -13.4
            which may also have contributed to the observed differential response to gemcitabine
            and combined carboplatin and paclitaxel treatment (Table S7).

            END-1 PDOs, both derived from distinct parts of the tumor lesion in the same ovary,
            demonstrated differential drug response to gemcitabine, WEE1-inhibitor adavosert-
            ib and AKT-inhibitor MK-2206 (Figure 4B, 4D, 4E). We identified genetic alterations
            in WWOX, ERBB2 and HRAS that might have contributed to the observed differen-
            tial response (Table S6, S7) 302–306 . However, even though END-1.2 achieved the low-
            est IC50-values for all three drugs, both END-1.1 and END-1.2 were classified in the
            high-responsive subgroup of gemcitabine and low-responsive subgroup of MK-2206
            and adavosertib (Figure 4B, 4D, 4E).

            HGS-3.1 and LGS-3.1 displayed drug responses that were very similar to their related
            PDOs (Figure 4; Table S3). In these related PDOs, differential response was only ob-
            served for the combined carboplatin and paclitaxel treatment, while drug responses
            were similar to carboplatin and paclitaxel mono-treatment. Two carboplatin-response
                          291
            associated genes , CLCN6 and MTHFR, exhibited copy number loss in the high-re-
            sponsive PDO LGS-3.1 (Table S7). Functional studies have not focused on CLCN6 and
            chemotherapy response, but have shown additive effects of MTHFR-inhibition and che-

               within related samples. Left panel: unrelated and related samples without differential response. Right panel:
               related samples that exhibited differential response. A color code for each patient is shown. The dotted
               line indicates the steady state (Css) or maximum (Cmax) in vivo plasma concentrations for all single drug
               treatments (Table S3).
               Additionally, drug response heterogeneity was examined in a patient from whom PDOs
               were obtained at multiple time points. HGS-1 was derived from primary chemosensi-
               tive disease and HGS-1-R2 and HGS-1-R3 were derived from recurrent chemoresistant
               disease, and together these PDOs reflected the clinical course of the patient. HGS-1-R2/
               R3 were less responsive to the mono- and combination treatment of carboplatin and pa-
               clitaxel compared to HGS-1 (Figure 4A, 4C; Table S3). Although HGS-1-R2 and HGS-
               1-R3 were derived from ascites collected within a timeframe of one month, differential
               responsiveness was observed to paclitaxel, gemcitabine and adavosertib (Figure 4A, 4B,
               4D).

               Moreover, we assessed if SVs (including gene fusions) in genes from the DGIdb resource
               could be linked to differential drug response. In the related PDOs derived from the eight
               patients that exhibited differential drug response, no SVs were identified that could ex-
               plain phenotypic heterogeneity. In addition to genetic heterogeneity in genes reported to
               influence drug response by the DGIdb, related PDOs also exhibited varying degrees of
               genome-wide heterogeneity at both the SNV and CNA levels (Figure 5). The PDOs have
               been sequenced at slightly different passage numbers, therefore the heterogeneity may
               also be influenced by tumor content (Table S7) and extended passaging, although we
 3             have previously shown that PDOs remained similar at the genomic level after extended   3
               passaging . The average number of unique SNVs and CNAs in all related PDOs were
                       278
               24% (2 to 70%) and 17% (0 to 100%), respectively. Considerable genomic heterogeneity
               at SNV level was observed in LGS-2 and MC-3 (30-70% unique SNVs per PDO), while
               these PDOs exhibited differential drug response to only one/two drugs. On the other
               hand, END-1 and LGS-5 had the lowest degree of genomic heterogeneity (2-14% unique
               SNVs per PDO) and exhibited heterogeneous response to three drugs. In conclusion, we
               did not observe a direct correlation between genome-wide heterogeneity and differential
               drug response.



               Discussion


               We have performed drug screening on 36 PDOs derived from 23 patients comprising all
               major OC histopathological subtypes. OC PDOs resembled the tumors they were de-
               rived from, with an average overlap of 67% of SNVs and similar CNA profiles. PDOs
               generated at interval debulking recapitulated clinical response to first-line carboplatin
               and paclitaxel combination treatment for histopathological (p=5.821e-05), biochemical
               (p=0.0004) and radiological (p=0.0092) outcomes.

               Diverse responses to registered drugs for OC were observed among PDOs. Low respon-
               siveness to first-line carboplatin (7/31, 23%) and paclitaxel (5/31, 16%) treatment was
               observed, compared to high responsiveness in the majority of patients to second-line
               gemcitabine treatment (29/35, 83%). All PDOs exposed to PARP-inhibition were found
               to be low responsive, in line with HR-proficiency classification based on WGS data. Re-
               sponse to targeted drugs under clinical investigation could partly be explained by genetic
               variation; low responsiveness to afatinib (12/25, 48%), low responsiveness to adavosertib
               (7/17, 41%), high responsiveness to flavopiridol (N=4/17, 24%) and high responsiveness
               to vemurafenib (5/7, 71%). Importantly, we identified a high responsiveness to at least
               one tested drug in nearly all patients (22/25, 88%). Since not all PDOs were exposed to
               the same number of drugs (3-13 monotherapies tested per patient), this is likely an un-

            derrepresentation. Finally, intrapatient tumor heterogeneity assessment in seven patients
            with organoids derived from multiple tumor locations, revealed differential response to
            at least one drug for all patients, indicating the importance to evaluate multiple tumor
            locations.

            In a systematic approach, we showed that PDO drug response correlated with several
            clinical response measures. This included histopathological assessment of tumor regres-
            sion according to a three-tier method (CRS) , which is recommended for assessment of

            the advantage to study each tumor site separately, as opposed to patient-wide measures
            of response such as CA-125, RECIST, and survival outcomes. Furthermore, it is a direct
            measure of chemotherapy response, whereas the survival outcomes may also be influ-
            enced by completeness of surgery, co-morbidity and other known prognostic factors.
                           285
            While Bohm et al.  previously reported that the prognostic significance of the CRS on
            omental tumor lesions was greater than on primary tumor sites, we applied it to all tu-
            mor locations where organoids were derived from. In this study, we present a correlation
            between CRS and PDO drug response to carboplatin and paclitaxel combination treat-
            ment.


            In order to bring PDO-based drug response assessment to the clinic, PDO establishment
            and drug screening needs to be performed within a short timeframe, preferably limited
            to the diagnosis-treatment interval. In line with previous studies 279,309–311 , we demon-
            strated that PDO establishment and drug screening is feasible within three weeks. Other
            studies showed a timeframe of one to two weeks. To further validate the predictive value
            of PDOs, we plan to undertake a prospective trial in which organoids will be derived
            from both primary and recurrent tumors and tested for response to drugs provided in
            the clinic, while clinical response is systematically monitored.


            Considering intrapatient drug response heterogeneity, derivation of organoids from
            multiple tumor locations of individual patients, may further improve treatment alloca-

            tion . Although sequencing studies have shown that OCs display extensive inter- and
            intratumor heterogeneity on a genetic level 78,283 , we could only partially link inter- and
            intratumor heterogeneous drug responses to genetic heterogeneity. Additionally, some
            of the CNAs that we identified in genes reported to be related to drug response by the
            DGIdb might be non-contributive passenger events, given the high frequency of CNAs
            in high-grade serous OC. Therefore, follow-up studies with increased sample sizes and
            deeper sequencing are required to decipher drug response associations with the candi-
            date genes identified here, and to discover novel resistance mechanisms. Importantly
            however, the lack of complete correlation between genetic and functional testing at this

               point, stresses the need for functional testing in addition to genetic testing to improve
               clinical decision making.


               The establishment of a larger collection of OC PDOs will provide the opportunity to
               determine comprehensive, clinically useful genotype-phenotype correlations. When a
               large collection including drug response data is available, treatment stratification can
               potentially be performed based on genomic or transcriptomic characteristics of specific
                                                                                312
               PDO subtypes, which could make organoid derivation dispensable in the future . This
 3             transition requires an accurate classification of drug-sensitive and -resistant PDOs. Sim-  3
               ilar to previous studies
                                      , OC PDOs were considered highly responsive if the drug
                                  288,289
               concentration that reduced viability of >50% of cells was lower than the concentration
               achievable in patient plasma (Css/Cmax). However, the Css/Cmax will vary between
               patients and is not necessarily the concentration that is achieved in the tumor 313,314 . In
               addition, sometimes patients require dose adjustments due to adverse events which also
               affect the drug concentration achievable in both plasma and tumor. Therefore, it should
               be taken into account that tumors predicted to be highly responsive based on the PDO
               drug response may clinically not respond. Prospective clinical trials comparing clinical
               to PDO drug response, should be complemented with plasma drug level measurements
               to further elucidate the relation between in vitro and clinical responsiveness.
               To conclude, OC PDOs provide a valuable preclinical model system to guide treatment
               choice in the clinic as it satisfies the following criteria; 1) PDOs genetically resemble the
               original tumor from which they are derived, 2) PDO drug response often reflects pa-
               tients’ clinical response, and 3) PDO establishment and drug screening can be performed
               within a short timeframe. Generating and testing PDOs of multiple tumor locations will
               provide insights in differential drug response as a result of tumor heterogeneity. This in-
               formation could improve treatment stratification and reduce the development of drug
               resistance. Complementary PDO drug screening and genomic analysis allows the link-
               age of genotypes with drug responsiveness patterns to identify candidate biomarkers for
               drug response.

            EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
            Patient samples and clinical data collection

            For this study we included women diagnosed with epithelial OC (median age: 65 years).
            Each patient signed informed consent and was able to withdraw her consent at any time.
            Tumor samples, ascites and blood samples were gathered between January 2016 and
            September 2019 at the University Medical Center Utrecht, and Leiden University Medi-
            cal Center, The Netherlands. Patient data and tissue collection was performed according
            to the guidelines of the European Network of Research Ethics Committees (EUREC)
            following European, national and local law. The Institutional Review Board of the UMC
            Utrecht (IRB UMCU) approved the biobanking protocol: 14-472 HUB-OVI. Clinical
            data was collected from the patient files. Patient samples were derived at primary disease
            during primary debulking surgery or interval debulking surgery, or adnex extirpation
            procedures. Upon recurrence, tissue was collected during (laparoscopic) surgery per-
            formed for treatment or diagnostic purposes, or ascites was collected during palliative
            drainage procedures. No statistical test was used to predetermine sample size.
            For the clinical-PDO drug response comparison we selected the samples that met all of
            the following three conditions: 1) samples were derived at interval debulking surgery;
            2) organoid drug response data to carboplatin/paclitaxel was available; 3) patient drug
            response to carboplatin/paclitaxel was available. For the intrapatient heterogeneity com-
            parison we selected all patients of whom multiple PDOs were derived.

               Organoid derivation and culture



               Organoids were derived from tumor samples of patients with OC and cultured accord-
               ing to our previously described protocol . Briefly, tumor tissue was cut into small piec-
                                                278
               es. Two random pieces were separated for fixation in formalin for histopathological anal-
               ysis and DNA isolation. The remaining tissue was minced, washed with 10 ml advanced
               DMEM/F12 containing 1x Glutamax, 10 mM HEPES and antibiotics (AdDF+++), col-
               lected in a tube, and centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes. Fragments were allowed to set-
 3             tle under normal gravity for 1 minute, and remaining big tissue pieces were digested in   3
               AdDF+++ supplemented with 5 µM RHO/ROCK pathway inhibitor (Y-27632) contain-
               ing 0.5–1.0 mg/ml collagenase at 37 °C for 0.5–1.0 h. Ascites/pleural effusion samples
               were centrifuged, and washed with AdDF+++. The cell pellet was allocated fixation in
               formalin, DNA isolation and organoid derivation. To eliminate erythrocytes, the samples
               for organoid derivation were incubated with 2 ml red blood cell lysis buffer for 5 min at
               room temperature followed by an additional wash with 10 ml AdDF+++ and centrifuga-
               tion at 300g for 5 minutes. Finally, the cells were embedded in BME (Cultrex growth fac-
               tor reduced BME type 2) on ice and seeded on pre-warmed 24-well suspension culture
               plates. Following BME polymerization, the cells were overlaid with appropriate organoid
               culture medium and incubated at 37°C in humidified air containing 5% CO2 (see Ta-
               ble S1). PDO names are informative of histological subtype, patient and tumor location.
               Histological subtype: HGS/LGS=high/low-grade serous adenocarcinoma, HG=high-
               grade adenocarcinoma, SBT/MBT=serous/mucinous borderline tumor, MC=mucinous
               adenocarcinoma, CCC=clear cell carcinoma, END=endometrioid carcinoma. The first
               number indicates the patient, the second number indicates tumor location.


               METHOD DETAILS
               In vitro PDO drug response testing

               PDO drug response testing was performed as previously described . In short, PDOs
                                                                       278
               were exposed to drugs in varying concentrations and to controls (DMSO, ABT-263/
               navitoclax) for 120 hours in 384-well plates, after which ATP levels were measured with
               the Cell-Titer Glo2.0 assay. All screens were performed in technical replicates. Biolog-
               ical replicates were performed in a subset of PDOs and drugs (Table S4) to investigate
               biological variation. Results were normalized to vehicle (DMSO = 100%) and baseline
               control (ABT-263/navitoclax 20 μM). Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6. Drug
               dose-response curves were visualized using linear regression analysis (setting: log(in-
               hibitor) vs. response; least squares (ordinary) fit; top constraint 100%). Concentrations
               where 50% cell viability (IC50-value) was reached were interpolated. The area under the
               curve (AUC) was approximated between the lowest and highest concentrations screened

            Clinical drug response measures
            Histopathological response was assessed with the chemotherapy response score (CRS)
            after three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, according to the guidelines described by
            Bohm et al. . All available hematoxylin and eosin stained slides of each tumor location
                      285
            from which we established PDOs were assessed for tumor purity. The slide with the most
     3      tumor per location was subsequently blinded scored by two certified pathologists (PvD,                                                                                          3
            CV), as CRS-1 (no or minimal pathological response), CRS-2 (appreciable pathological
            response) or CRS-3 (complete or near-complete pathological response). In case of dis-
            agreement consensus was reached. Radiological response was assessed according to the
                                                  287
            RECIST criteria for solid tumors (version 1.1) . A score for each patient was obtained,
            from best to worst response: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable dis-
            ease (SD), or progressive disease (PD). Biochemical response was measured by assessing
            response and timing of normalization (<35kU/L) of biomarker cancer antigen 125 (CA-
            125) . For progression-free survival (PFS) a cut-off of six months was employed; since
                286
            patients with less than six months PFS are predicted to be resistant to subsequent plati-
            num-treatment. For overall survival, 17 months was taken as a cut-off, based on survival
            data of a recent cohort of patients (2015-2016) with HGS OC stage IV disease by the
            Dutch Cancer Registration. Seventeen months after diagnosis, 50% of patients with HGS
            OC stage IV were still alive.


            DNA isolation and whole-genome sequencing

            DNA was isolated with the DNeasy Qiagen kit (PDOs and blood samples) and Genom-
            ic Tip Qiagen kit (tumor samples), supplemented with RNase treatment. Fresh frozen
            tumor material obtained through biopsy procedures was processed with the QiaSym-
            phony DSP DNA kit for low input. For DNA library preparation, 500–1,000 ng of DNA
            was used. Subsequently, whole-genome paired-end sequencing (WGS; 2x 150 bp) was
            performed on Illumina HiSeq X Ten and NovaSeq 6000 to a median coverage of 31X
            (range 24-45X).



            WGS data analysis
            WGS data were processed using the Hartwig Medical Foundation (HMF) somatic mu-
            tation workflow. We installed the pipeline (v4.8) locally using GNU Guix with the rec-
            ipe from https://github.com/UMCUGenetics/guix-additions. Full details and pipeline
            description are explained in detail by Priestley et al.  (https://github.com/hartwigmed-

               by PURPLE, meaning PURPLE failed to find any aneuploidy, and somatic variants were

               PDOs that a ploidy of 2 was most likely for those PDOs and tumor samples. Therefore,

               as predicted by SnpEff were considered. Similarly, germline SV calling was performed
               using GRIDSS and SV calls were filtered against the SV Panel of Normals from the HMF
               analysis pipeline, which can be found in https://resources.hartwigmedicalfoundation.nl.
               Since PURPLE requires tumor-normal pairs, CNA calling for these five samples was per-
               formed individually with Control-FREEC (v. 11.0) .

               Assessment of homologous recombination status

               To identify homologous recombination (HR)-deficient samples, BRCA1 and BRCA2 as
               well as other genes in the HR-pathway (BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK2, FANCA, PALB2,
               RAD50, RAD51(B/C/D)) were assessed for biallelic inactivation, incorporating both
               germline and somatic WGS data. Biallelic inactivation was defined as: a deep deletion
               (i.e. full loss of both alleles); or Loss-Of-Heterozygosity (LOH) in combination with (i)
               a known pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant according to ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.

            or essential splice variant as annotated by SnpEff (http://snpeff.sourceforge.net; v4.1h).
            Additionally, CHORD (Classifier of HOmologous Recombination Deficiency, v1.04)
            was employed to classify PDO samples as HR-proficient or -deficient based on the pres-
            ence of genome-wide somatic mutation contexts (primarily deletions with flanking mi-
            crohomology and 1-100kb structural duplications) . Samples without a germline refer-

            The Drug Gene Interaction database (DGIdb) was utilized as a resource to obtain a list
            of genes that have a known interaction with drug response . WGS data of PDOs were
                                                            291
            checked for SNVs, SVs and CNAs in DGIdb genes, in case differential drug response was
            observed within related PDOs. Homo-polymer regions were excluded. To identify sig-
            nificantly amplified and deleted genes we applied stringent criteria adopted from Priest-
                   29
            ley et al. . An amplification was defined as [minimum exonic copy number > three times
            the sample ploidy], while a deletion was defined as [minimum exonic copy number <0.5
            times the sample ploidy]. Related samples were regarded genetically heterogeneous on
            copy number level, if they presented with different copy-number states (amplified vs
            neutral vs deleted). Furthermore, differential response among related samples was only
            considered if the ploidy-corrected copy number levels were >10% apart.


            QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

            Descriptive statistics including mean, SD and SEM were conducted with R or GraphPad
            Prism. The significance level for 95% confidence interval was set to α=0.05. The Pearson
            correlation test was applied to evaluate the correlation between replicate experiments. The
            Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied for the comparison of clinical response groups.
            The means of two technical replicates of each sample at all measured drug concentrations
            were compared between clinical response groups (CRS-1 vs -2, RECIST SD vs PR, no
            CA-125 normalization vs normalization, PFS <6 months vs >=6 months, OS <17 months
            vs >=17 months). We corrected for multiple testing with the Bonferroni method (alpha =
            0.05 / 5 (tests)), resulting in a statistically significant threshold of p=0.01.

               Abstract


               Accurate detection of somatic structural variation (SV) in cancer genomes remains a
               challenging problem. This is in part due to the lack of high-quality gold standard datasets
               that enable the benchmarking of experimental approaches and bioinformatic analysis
               pipelines for comprehensive somatic SV detection. Here, we approached this challenge
               by genome-wide somatic SV analysis of the paired melanoma and normal lympho-
               blastoid COLO829 cell lines using four different technologies: Illumina HiSeq, Oxford
               Nanopore, Pacific Biosciences and 10x Genomics. Based on the evidence from multiple
               technologies combined with extensive experimental validation, including Bionano opti-
               cal mapping data and targeted detection of candidate breakpoint junctions, we compiled

            Introduction



            Structural genomic variations (SVs) form a major class of somatic genetic variation in
            cancer genomes 150,320 , involving dozens to thousands of somatic SVs with varying size
            distribution and patterns . While some SVs represent simple deletions, others tend to
                                 150
            be complex, involving multiple breakpoints across a relatively short genomic interval.
            For example, chromothripsis is a form of complex SVs frequently observed in cancer
            genomes 154,156 , resulting from aberrant chromosome segregation or telomere dysfunc-
            tion 321,322 . Other types of complex SVs involve oncogene amplifications arising from
            breakage-fusion-bridge cycles 148,150,208 . SVs  in  cancer genomes may  promote cancer
            development through a variety of mechanisms, such as oncogene activation through
     4      gene-fusions, disruption of tumor suppressor genes or by affecting gene regulation 323,324 .                                                                                    4
            Oncogenic fusion genes resulting from somatic SVs form important targets for cancer
                                                                          325
            drugs, and somatic SVs may form neo-antigenic targets for immunotherapies , demon-
            strating the relevance of accurate somatic SV detection for personalized cancer treat-
            ment 158,324 .


            While classical karyotyping and FISH analyses have been instrumental in systematic
            copy number analyses in tumor samples 158,324 , these technologies provide limited reso-
            lution or do not allow for comprehensive genome-wide analysis and are thus unable to
            resolve the complete spectrum of SV events. Most of our knowledge on genome-wide
            high-resolution SVs in cancer genomes stems from the analysis of short-read whole ge-
            nome sequencing, which is currently the only scalable and cost-efficient technology for
            high-resolution genome-wide cancer genome analysis 146,150 . Although short reads are ef-
            fective for detection of simple SV breakpoints in non-repetitive regions of the genome,
            the interrogation of complexly rearranged regions or the detection of SV breakpoints
            in low complexity genomic regions may require other sequencing techniques or target-
                        326
            ed approaches . For example, long-insert mate-pair sequencing has proven a valuable
            strategy for genome-wide mapping of somatic SVs 155,327  and single-cell template strand
            sequencing enables the detection of copy number variants and copy neutral structural
                   328
            variants . Furthermore, long-read sequencing methods, such as Pacific Biosciences and
            Oxford Nanopore and synthetic long-read approaches, such as linked-read technology
            by 10x genomics, provide a promising alternative for the detection of SVs. Initial studies
            have shown that long-read single-molecule sequencing can greatly improve detection of
            germline SVs 196,199,200,204 . Similarly, recent work has demonstrated the advantage of long-
            range sequence information for identification of SVs in cancer genomes, such as cancer
            gene amplifications and gene fusion events 179,208,211,329 .


            A major limitation of studies on cancer SVs is the lack of a comprehensive ground truth

               genome-wide somatic SV datasets including all types and sizes of somatic structural ab-
               errations. Such truth sets can form a resource for benchmarking sequencing and analysis
               approaches as well as for evaluating detection problems related to intratumor hetero-
               geneity and tumor purity. Gold reference truth sets have been established for germline
                                                            214
               SVs 199,213  or somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) . However, attempts at bench-
               marking somatic SVs have only been performed by using in silico simulated data 330,331 ,
                           332
               or mouse data .

               We addressed this caveat by generating a multiplatform short-read, long-read and
               linked-read sequencing and optical mapping dataset for the COLO829 melanoma cell
               line and the paired COLO829BL lymphoblastoid reference cell line. These cell lines have
 4             been used before to establish somatic SNV and copy number alteration (CNA) reference   4
                  214,333,334
                        . By cross-platform comparison and extensive validation we define a gold ref-
               sets
               erence set of 68 somatic SVs in COLO829. We evaluated the completeness of this validat-
               ed truth set and demonstrated its use to study the effect of tumor purity and sequencing
               coverage variation on the accuracy of somatic SV calling. We believe this somatic SV
               truth set to be of broad value for benchmarking and quality control of large-scale cancer
               genome sequencing studies, which are currently undertaken in research and the clinic.

               Multi-platform genome-wide  analysis of the COLO829 tumor-normal melanoma
               cell line pair



               In this study, we aimed at obtaining a comprehensive view on the genome structure
               of the COLO829 cancer cell line and identify a high-quality set of somatic structural
               variations, for use as a reference dataset. We cultured COLO829 and the correspond-
               ing lymphoblastoid cell line (COLO829BL) according to standard conditions (Materials
               and Methods). A large batch of cells expanded from one original vial directly obtained
               from the ATCC cell line repository was used for DNA isolation and subsequent genomic
               analysis using five different technology platforms: Illumina HiSeq Xten (ILL), Oxford
               Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Pacific Biosciences (PB), 10x genomics (sequenced on
               Illumina NovaSeq; 10X), and Bionano Genomics Saphyr optical mapping (BNG) (Ma-
               terials and Methods).

               The sequencing and optical mapping data were analyzed with respect to the reference
               human genome (GRCh37) using alignment methods specific for each technology (Ma-
               terials and Methods). From the combined short and long read sequencing data of the


                                                                                       93]]></page><page Index="102"><![CDATA[CHAPTER 4



            COLO829 sample we obtained a total average base coverage of 235X, while the BNG
            data generated an additional physical coverage of 218X. For the COLO829BL control
            cell line a combined average base coverage of 155X and a BNG physical coverage of 220X
            was reached (Figure 1A, Supplementary Table 1). Average physical molecule lengths
            were 534 bp for ILL paired-end inserts, 11 kb for ONT, 19 kb for PB and 98 kbp for BNG
            optical maps (Figure 1B, Supplementary Table 1).


            To assess the consistency of each of the technologies with respect to representation of
            the sequence content of the COLO829 cancer cell line, we determined the presence of
            copy number alterations. This revealed a highly similar copy number profile for each
            of the technologies (Figure 1C), with a correlation of copy number calls in the different
     4      datasets of 0.87-0.96 (Supplementary Figure 1A). Furthermore, we compared our copy                                                                                              4

            number calls with those generated in previous bulk  and single cell  sequencing of
                                                                     335
            COLO829. The overall CNA landscape of the bulk sequencing and the dominant clus-
            ter from single cell sequencing is very similar to the one we obtained (Supplementary
            Figure 1B), with a correlation of 0.99 (bulk) and 0.97 (single cell group A), (Supple-
            mentary Figure 1C). However, the previously described subclonal single cell clusters
            (B-D) possess some distinct copy number aberrations that are not observed in our bulk
            sequencing datasets (i.e. extra copy of chromosome 8 in group D or lack of gain in short
            arm of chromosome 1), in line with the proposed continuous genomic evolution of cell
            lines and subculture-specific nature of these events. Finally, classical FISH analysis for
            six genomic locations of the culture used in our study confirmed the sequencing derived
            chromosomal copy number states (Supplementary Figure 3D).



            Generation of a somatic structural variation consensus truth set


            To build an accurate and comprehensive somatic SV truth set, we used a combinatori-
            al analysis approach involving the four sequencing platforms (ILL, ONT, PB and 10X).
            Somatic SVs were obtained using state-of-the art SV calling approaches defined for each
            of the sequencing datasets (Materials and Methods, Figure 2A). SV calling parameters
            were not necessarily optimized for highest precision, but to high sensitivity to not miss
            out on any real event. As a result, individual candidate call sets for each technology re-
            sulted in highly variable lists of predicted somatic SVs, ranging from 92 breakpoint calls
            in ILL up to 6,412 for ONT, adding up to a total of 8,831 merged candidate somatic SV
            calls (Figure 2A). Only 18 of those somatic SV calls were found by all four sequencing
            approaches and 125 SV calls were supported by at least two call sets (Supplementary
            Figure 2A).
            To make an initial assessment of accuracy, we selected 88 high-confidence SV candidates


          94]]></page><page Index="103"><![CDATA[A MULTI-PLATFORM REFERENCE FOR SOMATIC STRUCTURAL VARIATION DETECTION



               for PCR validation based on visual inspection of the mapped reads using IGV. In ad-
               dition, we randomly selected 296 additional SV candidates for PCR validation. Based
               on short and long read sequencing of the PCR products, 63 of these breakpoints were
               labelled as PCR validated (Supplementary Figure 2B). Moreover, we decided to per-
               form a separate validation of all 8,831 somatic SV calls from the union of the four SV
               callsets, using a capture-based enrichment method using multiple probes flanking and
               overlapping each candidate break-junction (Materials and Methods). Based on the short
               read sequencing of the enriched products, 114 breakpoints were labelled as capture val-
               idated (Supplementary Figure 2B). Lastly, we used the 52 BNG somatic SV calls as an
               additional layer of validation. In total, 137 SV calls were validated by at least one of the
               methods aforementioned. Additionally, 78 SV calls were not validated but still supported
 4             by more than one technology. (Figure 2A, Supplementary Figure 2C).           4

            Next, we manually curated these 215 SV calls that were either validated or supported by
            multiple technologies. Based on visual inspection of the genomic alignment data from
            each of the sequencing sets and the validation experiment results, we assessed each SV
            call individually. We found that 14 calls were actually duplicate calls of the same event
            (but annotated slightly different by different data analysis pipelines), 48 were real events
            but also had evidence in the germline control, and another 98 were considered false posi-
            tive as the supporting or reference data was very noisy at the given genomic location (also
            in the independent validation data) and may thus reflect the impact of low confidence
            regions in the reference genome for which unambiguous mapping of sequencing reads is
            complicated due to simple sequence or repeat content. Taken together, we conclude that
     4      68 of the SV candidates are real somatic events and thus considered our truth set (Figure                                                                                       4
            2A, Supplementary Figure 2C, Supplementary Table 2 with all validations and raw
            calls). To verify the efficacy of our manual curation approach, we randomly selected 179
            SV calls that were supported by a single technology and not validated, and therefore left
            out from the candidate SV curation pipeline, and also evaluated them manually. All these
            SV calls were either germline events (63, 35%) or false positive due to noisy mapping data
            (116, 65%) (Supplementary Figure 2D).

               Of the compiled set of 68 validated somatic SVs in COLO829, 55 (81%) were present in
               more than two original call sets, including the 18 SVs detected by all technologies (Fig-
               ure 2B). Moreover, most of the SVs were validated at least by capture-based enrichment
               and by PCR (50, 74%). Additionally, 8 somatic SVs were validated by capture-based en-
               richment but not by PCR and vice versa, 7 somatic SVs were validated by PCR but not
               by capture-based enrichment. Of the remaining 3 SVs, one was validated by BNG and 2
               were not validated by any targeted assay but are supported by multiple technologies and
               manually verified by inspection of raw sequencing data from both tumor and normal
               samples (Figure 2C). The resulting somatic SV truth set is presented in Supplementary

               Characterization of the COLO829 somatic SV truth set



               The somatic SV truth set consists of 38 deletions, 3 insertions, 7 duplications, 7 inversions
               and 13 translocations (Figure 3A). Most of the deletions (24, 61%) are larger than 10kbp,
               and 7 are smaller than 100bp. There are also three duplications and three inversions larg-
               er than 10kbp. Two tumor driver genes are affected by somatic SVs in COLO829 (Sup-
               plementary Table 3). First, there are two large heterozygous deletions (72 kb and 141 kb)
               in FHIT, located in the fragile site FRA3B on chromosome 3, which is commonly affect-
               ed by somatic SVs . Second, there is a homozygous 12 kbp deletion affecting PTEN on
                              150
               chromosome 10.
               Frequently, SVs do not occur as simple isolated events but are part of a complex land-
               scape induced in a single event like for example chromothripsis or due to a cascade of
               events over time like breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. There are also 2 clusters of com-
               plex chained somatic SVs that affect 3 or more chromosomes and involve more than 5
               breakpoint junctions. Both of them resemble breakage-fusion-bridge events, since they
               are flanked by foldback inversions and show oscillating copy number profiles . One of
                                                                              150
               them occurred in chromosome 3 and involves four foldback inversions, two of which
               have templated insertions from chromosomes 10 and 12 and chromosome 6, respec-
               tively (Figure 3C). The breakpoint and copy number profile of chromosome 3 can be
               fully explained by 4 cycles of breakage-fusion-bridge followed by chromatid duplication
               through a whole genome doubling event. Initiated by replication of unrepaired dou-
               ble-stranded break, the unstable chromosome 3 (due to the presence of two centromeres
               in a single chromatid) underwent a further 3 more rounds of BFB with a fragment of

            after the final breakage through repair to one of the centromeres (Supplementary Mov-
            ie). The other breakage-fusion-bridge event occurred on chromosome 15 and includes
            templated insertions from chromosomes 6 and 20 (Figure 3D). The donor locations of
            these templated insertions are not affected by SV events.

            To evaluate the completeness of the somatic SV truth set, we compared it with the somat-
            ic CNA calls, since each CNA should have SV breakpoints or telomeres at either end. We
            found 43 total CNA breakpoints that are not telomeric ends of chromosomes. Of these,
            26 (60%) are concurrent with an SV breakpoint. We evaluated the rest of the CNAs in the
            raw genomic data (Supplementary table 4). Six more copy number breakpoints (14%)
            are present in the germline, flanking heterozygous germline CNA events that are homo-
     4      zygous in the tumor through a somatic loss of the other allele. The SV break-junctions                                                                                          4
            of these CNAs are germline and therefore not part of the truth set. Finally, there are 11
            somatic CNA breakpoints (26%) not concurrent with an SV breakpoint. Five of these
            missing CNA breakpoints are located in a centromeric region (chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 14
            and 16) and are likely due to a missing somatic SV involving the centromere, which are
            typically hard to fully resolve due to their repetitive nature. For another 2 missing CNA
            breakpoints (chromosome 3 and chromosome 9) breakends can be found in the raw ILL
            dataset, meaning an SV breakpoint was found but the SV junction partner could not
            be unequivocally determined. GRIDSS2 annotation did reveal that the chromosome 3
            single break does map to one of the centromeres. Four more missing CNA breakpoints
            flank two supposed deletions in chromosome 1, but no SV call in these locations can be
            found for either COLO829 or COLO829BL in any of the datasets. Manual inspection of
            the raw data for these CNAs (Supplementary Figure 3A, 3B) indicates that these CNAs
            may actually reflect heterozygous germline events followed by LOH as witnessed by the
            lower read coverage in the COLO829BL as compared to the flanking segments. Further-
            more, one CNA involves a LINE-rich region while the other overlaps with a segmental
            duplication.

            Next, we compared our somatic SV truth set to the somatic SV calls presented by Arora
            et al. They provide two different somatic SV callsets, one generated by the HiSeq plat-
            form with 77 somatic SV calls and the other by the NovaSeq platform with 75 somatic SV
            calls. Since these were provided based on GRCh38 genomic coordinates, we lifted our
            somatic SV coordinates over to GRCh38. We found that 58 (75.34%) and 59 (78.6%) of
            the somatic SV calls for the HiSeq and the NextSeq callsets, respectively, overlapped with
            our somatic SV truth set on both sides of the SV (Supplementary Figure 3). We manu-
            ally inspected the 20 non-overlapping somatic SV calls from the Arora et al dataset in our
            raw ILL, ONT and PB data (Supplementary Table 5). In the long-read raw data (ONT
            and PB) only 3 out of the 20 have some support (maximum 3 reads). In the ILL raw data,

               9 out of the 20 have limited evidence, with only one or a few supporting reads. Only 4
               of these 9 SV calls passed bioinformatic calling criteria in our original ILL somatic SV
               calls, but none of these were called by any other technology or independently validated
               by more sensitive PCR or targeted capture and deep-sequencing. Therefore we consid-
               er these candidates as technology-specific noise and were discarded from our truth set,
               although we can formally not exclude that these are real variants that are present at very
               low frequency (<1% in the sample). Finally, 13 SVs are present in our truth set and not in
               the Arora et al. data set. All were detected by at least two different sequencing techniques
               and independently validated.

            Effect of tumor purity and sequencing depth on somatic SV calling

            To demonstrate the utility of the COLO829 somatic SV truth set, we evaluated the ef-
            fect of tumor purity, which is highly variable amongst clinical samples, on SV calling.
            We used the available raw datasets and simulated tumor purities of 75% (TP75), 50%
            (TP50), 25% (TP25), 20% (TP20), and 10% (TP10) by random in silico mixing of the
            genomic data from COLO829 and COLO829BL for ILL, ONT and PB, respectively. We
            performed SV calling independently on each of these mixed sets and on the original
            tumor file (100% purity, TP100) and the normal file (0% purity, TP0). We then calculated
            the recall (percentage of truth set found) and precision (percentage of calls that belong to
            truth set). With the standard settings used, somatic SV recall and precision were found
            to be highly dependent on tumor purity for all three technologies. At TP75 and TP100,
     4      recall is the highest, with >94% for ILL, >67% for ONT and >65% for PB. With TP50,                                                                                              4
            the recall slightly decreases to 90%, 52% and 61% for ILL, ONT and PB, respectively. For
            purities lower than TP50, the recall decreases further to <76%, <22% and <48% for ILL,
            ONT and PB, respectively. Precision follows a similar trend in the case of ILL, with pre-
            cisions >78% for purities larger than TP50, and a drop to 63% in TP25. In the case of
            ONT and PB, the higher number of false positives impact severly on the precision rates,
            potentially reflecting maturity level of platform-specific tools for somatic SV detection
            in tumor-normal paired samples, but also presenting opportunities for further analysis
            parameter and tool optimisation.
            Sequencing depth is another essential parameter to consider in tumor sequencing proj-
            ects as it represents a trade-off decision between variant detection sensitivity and costs.
            To investigate the effect of sequencing depth in combination with tumor purity in somat-
            ic SV detection, we took one of the triplicates from each of the simulated ILL tumor pu-
            rities (98x coverage) and subsampled them to 50x, 30x, 10x, 5x and 1x depths. We again
            performed somatic SV calling using the same standard pipeline on each of these sim-
            ulated sets and calculated recall and precision. We observed that for depths of 50x and
            98x and tumor purities over 50% recall was over 82%. In the case of 98x, even at TP20 a
            recall of 71% could be obtained, whereas for 50x at TP25 the recall decreased to 42%. For
            30x sequencing depth, at TP100 recall was 84%, but at TP50 there was a decrease to 54%
            and at TP25 further to 10%. For lower coverages, recall was low. Surprisingly, depths of
            30x and 50x had a higher precision at all tumor purities than 98x, with precision around
            95% over TP50, compared to approximately 70% for 98x. While this could in theory be
            explained by the presence of subclonal SVs that are not included in the reference truth
            set but become detectable at higher sequencing depth, this might also be caused by sto-
            chastic effects due to increased measurement noise at higher sequencing depth which
            increases the number of false positive and therefore reduces precision (although recall is
            not affected). Further optimization of analysis tools and settings and deeper sequencing
            may resolve these issues.

               COLO829 and COLO829BL for the ILL, ONT, and PB datasets. (A) Somatic SV calling was performed

               For each tumor purity subset in the ILL dataset, different sequencing depths (1, 5, 10, 30, 50 and 98x) were
               sampled. Somatic SV calling was performed independently for each sequencing depth and tumor purity
               subset and recall (left) and precision (right) were calculated against the COLO829 somatic SV truth set.

               Discussion



               We produced a validated somatic SV truth set by building upon the strengths of different
               sequencing technologies. Bioinformatic integration of results and large-scale indepen-
               dent validation strategies turned out to be a powerful approach for reducing the large
               number of candidate events obtained. Manual curation and inspection of raw sequenc-
               ing data was however essential to exclude sequencing, mapping artefacts and remaining
               germline events. These somatic false positives are thus germline false negatives and were
               likely included in the initial somatic SV calls due to the lower sequencing analysis depths
               for the control sample as compared to the tumor (typically 3-fold lower) in combination
               with specific local genomic characteristics (e.g. lower average coverage due to for exam-
               ple local GC content or involving low complexity sequences) .
                                                                336

               While reconstruction of the derived chromosomal tumor genome topology based on
               the 68 truth set somatic SVs results in an overall stable genomic configuration for most
               derived chromatids harboring a single centromere and two telomeres, some breakpoint
               junctions are still clearly missing. This is corroborated by the fact that not for all copy
               number alterations breakpoint junctions were identified at either end. Our results indi-
               cate that these missing events typically involve centromeric regions that are not direct-
               ly accessible by any current sequencing technology. Annotation data provided by the

            3 and the centromere in chromosome 1, which shows a copy number change. This can
            probably not be resolved directly due to the repeated nature of the centromeric region.
            When excluding the missing events that likely involve centromeres, there are 2 copy
            number aberrations that remain unexplained by the truth set, providing room for fur-
            ther improvement based on the existing or to be generated data.


            Although this study was not designed to compare performance of sequencing platforms
            or data analysis pipelines, some interesting observations can be made. First, there is clear
            complementarity between the various platforms for the comprehensive identification of
            all real events. However, bioinformatic pipelines for somatic SV detection are still clear-
     4      ly in different stages for the different platforms with the most commonly used Illumi-                                                                                          4
            na-based approaches yielding lowest numbers of false positives. We believe future tool
            optimisation for somatic SV calling, assisted by gold reference truth sets as well as the
            development of platform-specific germline and artefact filtering data sets (‘pools of nor-
            mals’) based on large numbers of samples, will effectively address this challenge. Second,
            data analysis pipelines yield different annotations for the same event. This calls for fur-
            ther standardisation of variant annotation and nomenclature, although some observed
            differences are intrinsic to the use of short and long-read technologies. For example, a
            long templated insertion may be called as two independent translocations by short-read
            SV callers, while long read-based technology would detect this readily as an insertion.
            Third, despite previous studies showing the added value of long reads for SV detection
            for germline events, our somatic SV truth set is resolved almost in its entirety with the
            ILL short read dataset. While this may in part be due to the more advanced somatic SV
            calling pipelines developed for short-read data, this observation may also be explained by
            fundamental differences between germline and somatic SVs, where the latter are much
            more randomly distributed throughout the genome than inherited germline events.
            Germline variants more often involve complex or repetitive regions of the genome which
            might reflect mechanistic differences like for example the more frequent involvement of
            non-allelic homologous recombination, or be due to differences in selective pressure. As
            a consequence, somatic events may thus on average be more effectively detected.
            The COLO829 cell line has the advantage that it is, in contrast to real tumor samples, a re-
            newable source that can be used for assessing the impact of future platform developments
            or the performance of completely new technologies for somatic mutation detection. Al-
            though the COLO829 cell line is representative for structural variation as observed in
            cancer, including small and large copy number alterations (including aneuploidies) and
            both simple and complex SV events, it is not necessarily representative in all aspects for
            real tumor samples. First, tumor samples do typically not consist of tumor cells only but
            are a mix of tumor and normal cells (e.g. stromal cells and infiltrating immune cells). We

               show that the raw data obtained in this study can be used effectively to mimic variable
               tumor purity and that the truth set is instrumental for assessing the performance of the
               bioinformatic data analysis tools at variable tumor purity. As expected, our results show
               that both recall and precision heavily depend on tumor purity for all platforms. Secondly,
               tumors evolve continuously and are typically genetically heterogeneous, especially pri-
               mary tumors, involving potentially subclonal SV events. While the COLO829 cell line
               has been shown to be genetically heterogeneous and evolving over time and thus could
               in principle capture this tumor feature properly, this variation is dynamic and might be
               variable between cell line isolates as already demonstrated by the various studies on this
               cell line 334,335  and thus limit the utility of a single defined truth set obtained as present-
               ed here. Finally, tumors are in general very heterogeneous both within the context of a

               mance of a specific sequencing technique or data analysis tool is of course not captured
               in a single cell line and requires the development of complementary datasets. Analysing
               additional cancer cell lines with matching normal cell lines provide an attractive route
               towards this goal as these represent in principle an endless source of genomic material
               for benchmarking of future DNA analysis technologies, but also for quality monitoring
               in routine production labs under accreditation. However, availability of suited cell lines
               that represent the full genetic diversity of cancer is a clear limitation. Ideally, one would
               thus resort to thoroughly analysed real tumor samples, even though in practice availabil-
               ity of sufficient material for multi-lab and multi-technology analyses can be problematic
               and sharing and reusing of patient material and data may require complex consenting
               and legal procedures.


               Taken together, we believe the SV truth set described here as well as the underlying raw
               data, are a valuable resource for benchmarking and fine-tuning analysis settings of so-
               matic SV calling tools, but the data may also be used for the development of novel anal-
               ysis tools, for example phasing of structural variants. All analysis results and raw data
               are publicly available to enable such applications without access restrictions (ENA ac-
               cession number: PRJEB27698 and an overview of the available data and specific access

            platform choice and experimental design in relation to diagnostic accuracy and overall
            costs. Furthermore, these results highlight the need of benchmarking somatic SV de-
            tection methods at different tumor purities and sequencing depths rather than under
            a single fixed condition, since these parameters are highly variable within and between
            cohorts and can result in strong performance variation.



            Materials and Methods


            Sample source: COLO829 (ATCC® CRL-1974™) and COLO829BL (ATCC® CRL-
     4      1980™) cell lines were obtained from ATCC in September 2017. A single batch of cells                                                                                            4
            was thawed and cells were expanded and grown according to standard procedures as
            recommended by ATCC. Cell pellets were split for technology-specific DNA isolation at
            33 days (COLO829 & COLO829BL for the ILL and ONT datasets), 35 days (COLO829
            for the PB, 10X and BNG datasets) and 23 days (COLO829BL for the PB, 10X and BNG
            datasets).

            Genomic analyses per technology
            Illumina: COLO829 and COLO829BL libraries were prepped with Truseq Nano reagent
            kit and sequenced on the HiSeq X Ten platform using standard settings and reagent kits
            (chemistry version V2.5). Reads were mapped to GRCh37 with BWA mem (version
                 340
            0.7.5) , followed by indel realignment with GATK (v3.4-46) . SVs were called joint-

            ly for COLO829 and COLO829BL with GRIDSS (v2.0.1) . Somatics SVs were filtered
            with the GRIDSS somatic SV filtering script (https://github.com/PapenfussLab/gridss/
            blob/master/scripts/gridss_somatic_filter.R).

            Nanopore: COLO829 and COLO829BL libraries were sequenced on the MinION and
            GridION platforms using R9.4 flow cells. Reads were mapped to GRCh37 with NGMLR
            (v0.2.6, default parameters)  with default parameters. SV calling was performed with

                            342
            NanoSV and Sniffles were merged with SURVIVOR (v1.0.6)  with a distance of 200 bp
                                                             343
            and calls with evidence in COLO829BL for NanoSV or Sniffles were discarded.
            PacBio: COLO829 and COLO829BL libraries were sequenced on the Sequel System
            with the 5.0 chemistry (binding kit 101-365-900; sequencing kit 101-309-500). Reads
            were mapped to GRCh37 with minimap2 (v2.11-r797) . SVs were called jointly for

               a supporting read in COLO829BL.


               10X: COLO829 and COLO829BL 10x genomics libraries were prepared on the Chro-
               mium platform and sequenced on the NovaSeq platform (chemistry version V1). Reads
               were analyzed with the LongRanger WGS pipeline (v2.2.2) separately for COLO829 (so-

               Bionano: DNA for COLO829 and COLO829BL was labelled using the Bionano Direct
 4             Label and Stain (DLS) kit. The labelled DNA was linearized in a Saphyr chip and imaging   4
               was performed on the Saphyr instrument. SV calling was performed on the Bionano Ac-
               cess platform. For each sample, 1.5 million cultured cells were used to purify ultra-high
               molecular weight DNA using the SP Blood & Cell Culture DNA Isolation Kit following
               manufacturer instructions (Bionano genomics, San Diego USA). Briefly, after counting,
               white blood cells were pelleted (2200g for 2mn) and treated with LBB lysis buffer and
               proteinase K to release genomic DNA (gDNA). After inactivation of proteinase K by
               PMSF treatment, genomic DNA was bound to a paramagnetic disk, washed and elut-
               ed in an appropriate buffer. Ultra-High molecular weight DNA was left to homogenize
               at room temperature overnight. The next day, DNA molecules were labeled using the
               DLS (Direct Label and Stain) DNA Labeling Kit (Bionano genomics, San Diego USA).
               Seven hundred and fifty nanograms of gDNA were labelled in presence of Direct Label
               Enzyme (DLE-1) and DL-green fluorophores. After clean-up of the excess of DL-Green
               fluorophores and rapid digestion of the remaining DLE-1 enzyme by proteinase K, DNA
               backbone was counterstained overnight before quantitation and visualization on a Sa-
               phyr instrument. A volume of 8.5 microliter of labelled gDNA solution of concentration
               between 4 and 12ng/µl was loaded on the Saphyr chip and scanned on the Saphyr in-
               strument (Bionano genomics, San Diego USA). A total of 1.6 Tb and 1.5 Tb of data was
               collected for the cancer and blood sample, respectively.


               De novo assembly Pipeline and Copy number variants calling were performed and
               against the Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37 (GRCh37) HG19 human
               genome assembly (RefAligner version 7520). Events detected by the de novo assembly
               pipeline were subsequently compared against the matched blood control, and those that
               are absent in the assembly or the molecules of the control were considered as somatic
               variants.

            Average molecular length and length distribution was calculated based on insert size for
            ILL, read length for ONT and PB, on synthetic molecular length based on the MI tag for

            Validations
            Capture: For each break-junction of the merged somatic SV calls 2 capture probes of
            100 bp in length were designed, one at either side of the breakpoint, with a maximum
            distance of 100bp from the breakpoint at GC percentage as close as possible to 50%, for
            a total of 18148 custom probes. These custom capture probes were then ordered from
            Twist Biosciences. Then, libraries for COLO829 and COLO829BL were prepared and
            hybridized with the biotin-labelled custom targeted probes following the manufactur-
            er’s protocol (Twist Biosciences catalog IDs: 100253, 100255, 100527, 100400). Using
            streptavidin beads the hybridized DNA was pulled from the DNA pool, and amplified

               dissociated using trypsin, counted, washed and diluted to contain a total of 50,000 cells
               in 100 µl. Monolayer cell suspensions were concentrated on a microscope slide using
               cytospin. Then, FISH was performed according to diagnostic standards. Slides were vi-

               were recorded.

               SV selection pipeline
               Merged somatic SV calls were overlapped with the validation outcomes with SURVI-
               VOR (v. 1.0.6)  using an overlap distance of 50bp (PCR, CAPTURE) and 1kbp (BNG).

               Only somatic SV calls with support from multiple datasets and calls with support from a
               single dataset which were validated were selected. SVs involving unstable microsatellites
               were not considered as part of our analyses. All calls were manually curated by using

            CAPTURE). We evaluated each of these image datasets independently and classified
            each somatic SV call as “somatic”, “germline” or “false positive”. We also used the Integrat-

                                                 335
            were obtained from Velazquez-Villareal et al. . These datasets were then merged using
     4      1MB bins to calculate Pearson’s correlation between datasets and for plotting.                                                                                                  4

            The two somatic SV sets from Arora et al.  (HiSeq and NovaSeq sets, https://www.
            nygenome.org/bioinformatics/3-cancer-cell-lines-on-2-sequencers/) were  download-
            ed. Since these are BEDPE files based on GRCh38 genomic coordinates, we converted
            our somatic SV truth set to BEDPE format and lifted it to those coordinates using the
            liftOver tool from UCSC. We then intersected those SV sets with our truth set using Bed-
            tools (v2.25.0)  and differentiated between SVs with overlap on both sides, overlap only
                        346
            on one side and not overlapping. We lifted all SVs with no overlap or one-sided overlap
                                                             352
            and manually evaluated them in our data using IGV (v2.4.0) .
            Tumor purity and sequencing depth analysis
            For tumor purity simulations in each of the ILL, ONT and PB datasets, COLO829 and
            COLO829BL BAM files were randomly subsampled and mixed in different ratios, de-
            pendent on the sequencing depth to achieve in silico tumor purities of 10, 20, 25, 50
            and 75 with Sambamba (v0.6.5) . The same somatic SV calling pipeline used for the
                                       345
            different datasets was applied to each of the tumor purity subsets. The resulting somatic
            SV file of each tumor purity subset was overlapped using a window of 100bp with the
            truth set VCF to determine the number of true and false positives and true negatives.
            This experiment was performed in triplicate for each tumor purity and each technology
            with the original COLO829 BAM file as positive control (100% tumor purity) and the
            original COLO829BL BAM file as negative control (0% tumor purity).
            For sequencing depth simulations using the ILL dataset, one of the triplicates from each
            tumor purity simulation was selected together with the COLO829 and COLO829BL
            files. Each of these BAM files was subsampled to depths of 1x, 5x, 10x, 30x and 50x (plus
            the original 98x) with Sambamba (v0.6.5) . Somatic SV calling was performed inde-
                                               345
            pendently for each of the subsets and the resulting somatic SV VCF file was overlapped
            with the truth set to determine the number of true and false positives and false negatives.

               Supplementary  Movie:  Reconstruction  of  the  breakage-fusion-bridge  event  in  chromosome  3.
               Animated reconstruction of a breakage-fusion-bridge event consistent with the breakpoints and copy
               number profile of chromosome 3 in COLO829. This circos plot shows the evolution in time and over
               various cell divisions of the chromosome involving 4 cycles of breakage-fusion-bridge followed by a genome
               doubling event. The innermost track shows minor allele ploidy (orange indicates loss, blue amplification). The
               next track shows the copy number profile (purple indicates loss, green amplification). The line track shows
               the reconstructed chromosome. Breakpoints are represented by triangles and connecting arcs, telomeric
               ends of the chromosome by squares, and unrepaired double-stranded breaks by circles. DNA gained by
               replication and new breakpoints formed through DNA repair are indicated in blue, with lost DNA in orange.
               The outer track shows chromosome number and coordinate. A non-linear chromosomal coordinate scale
               is used with distances between breakpoints shown in black overlaying the copy number track. A cell cycle
               clock is shown in the upper left corner indicating at what point in the cell cycle each rearrangement occurs.
               The final stabilising repair to the centromere of another chromosome is omitted for clarity. Available online

                                  INDIVIDUALIZED CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA-BASED DISEASE MONITORING IN CANCER PATIENTS

               Abstract



               Somatic genomic structural variations (SVs) are promising personalized biomarkers to
               quantify circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in liquid biopsies as they represent unique
               tumor derived molecules. However, in most solid malignancies these SVs are variable
               and can be located anywhere in the genome thus the complexity of the identification of
               personalized SVs hinders routine use in the clinic. Here, we developed a novel approach
               for rapid discovery of a set of patient-specific somatic SVs. We combine low coverage
               cancer genome sketching using Oxford Nanopore sequencing with a machine learning
               approach to detect a set of somatic SVs. We analyzed tumor samples of high-grade ovar-
               ian and prostate cancer patients, successfully identified candidate SVs and validated on
               average ten somatic SVs per patient with breakpoint-spanning PCR mini-amplicons.
               These SVs could be quantified in ctDNA samples of patients with metastatic prostate
               cancer using a digital PCR assay. The SV quantification in these longitudinal samples
 5             suggest that indeed SV dynamics correlate with and may improve other response bio-  5

               markers such as PSA. Our work enables rapid and cost-effective identification of a set of

            Background



            The detection of cancer recurrence as well as accurate and fast monitoring of response to
            treatment currently lacks sensitivity for detection of changes over time 353,354 . Liquid biop-
            sies, which can be used to detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from body fluids, such
            as blood, in a minimally invasive manner, are a promising approach to improve moni-
            toring of tumor burden over time 52,355 . Circulating tumor DNA, which originates from
            apoptotic and necrotic tumor cells, has been shown to have a positive linear correlation
            with tumor burden . In multiple cases, ctDNA analysis identified cancer recurrence
                            356
            months before clinical symptoms presented 54,69,165 .

            As ctDNA is only a fraction of the total circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA), it should
            be distinguished from cfDNA from normal cells by identification of ctDNA-specif-
            ic genetic alterations. Genomic structural variations (SVs) represent tumor- and ctD-
     5      NA-specific biomarkers to detect and quantify ctDNA with high sensitivity in liquid                                                                                             5

            biopsies 69,165,166,357 . Most solid cancers contain dozens to hundreds of somatic SVs 29,150 .
            Besides some recurrent driver SV events that functionally impact tumorigenesis, the vast
                                                                            146
            majority of these somatic SVs are patient- and tumor specific passenger events , which
            may nevertheless be good biomarkers for tumor load tracing. SVs form a unique break-
            point junction between two joined DNA strands and can be validated by straightforward
                                                                           165
            junction-spanning (quantitative) PCR assays, which facilitates its applicability .

            Somatic SVs are commonly detected with short-read, paired-end next generation se-
            quencing (NGS). However, as SVs can be very large, short reads are less suited for SV
            detection 199,200,358 .  Recently,  long-read  sequencing  techniques  from  Oxford  Nanopore
            Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) have emerged and their increased
            power for germline and somatic SV detection has been extensively demonstrated
            199,200,203,204,208 . Moreover, ONT enables a short turnaround time and real-time data anal-
               188
            ysis .

            To enable rapid and cost-efficient identification of a set of patient-specific somatic SVs
            for ctDNA monitoring, we developed a pipeline that leverages the long-read and fast
            sequencing capabilities of nanopore sequencing in combination with a computational
            method that enables accurate selection of a subset of somatic SVs from low coverage
            nanopore sequencing data. The method detects a subset of genomic SVs and can be
            applied to tumor tissue obtained from (needle) biopsy or resection. The computational
            approach combines SV calling with random forest classification and germline SV filter-
            ing against a blacklist to enrich for somatic SVs without the need of matching germline
            sequencing data, which reduces the cost and time of the assay. We were able to design

               Detection of somatic structural variations from low coverage nanopore
               sequencing of tumor biopsies


               The first step of our analysis involves low coverage nanopore sequencing of genomic
               tumor-derived DNA (Figure 1A). A single nanopore run on the MinION or GridION
 5             platforms typically generates between 5-15 Gbs of data , corresponding to 1.5-5x cov-  5
                                                            183
               erage of the human genome. Next, the low coverage sequencing data are mapped to the
               reference genome followed by the detection of SV breakpoint junctions from split read
               mappings (Figure 1B) . Subsequently, a classification and filtering pipeline is applied to
                                 204
               enrich for somatic SV breakpoints irrespective of corresponding germline data (Figure
               1B). Finally, PCR assays with mini-amplicons are designed to validate the 20 most likely
               somatic SVs. SVs are confirmed as either somatic or germline by breakpoint PCR on
               tumor and corresponding lymphocyte DNA (Figure 1C). Successful breakpoint PCR
               assays for somatic SVs can then be utilized as biomarkers for ctDNA-based monitoring
               of treatment response and disease recurrence (Figure 1D).



               Establishment of a somatic SV reference set


               To verify the ability of our pipeline to detect somatic SVs, we used genomic data from
               the melanoma cell line COLO829  and the ovarian cancer organoid line HGS-3 . We
                                           333
                                                                                 278
               utilized short-read WGS data from both lines (90x and 30x coverage for COLO829 and
               HGS-3, respectively) and matching reference samples (30x coverage in both cases) to es-
               tablish two reference sets of somatic SVs (Methods). By using a state-of-the-art somatic
               SV detection pipeline 330,337,359,360 , we detected 92 and 295 somatic SVs in COLO829 and
               HGS-3, respectively. Additionally, we generated long-read nanopore sequencing data for
               COLO829 and HGS-3, reaching high coverages of 59x (COLO829) and 56x (HGS-3)
               (Suppl. Figure 1 and Suppl. Table 1). To simulate low coverage long-read sequencing of
               tumor genomes, we randomly subsampled the nanopore sequencing reads to coverages
               of 4x, 3x and 2x. The subsampling was performed 20 times independently for each case,

               germline and tumor DNA to confirm somatic SVs. (D) Somatic SVs are used as biomarkers and traced
               within cfDNA from a patient to monitor disease dynamics in a longitudinal manner.

               Next, we tested our ability to detect SVs from high and low coverage nanopore sequenc-
               ing data. We used NanoSV, a previously validated nanopore SV caller 203,204 , to call SVs
               from the nanopore sequencing data. To maximize sensitivity, we performed SV calling
               using lenient settings on high and low coverage COLO829 and HGS-3 Nanopore data-
               sets. (Suppl. Table 2). Based on the overlap with the somatic short-read reference set,
               raw SV calls were classified as somatic (true-positives) or non-somatic (false-positives).
               As expected, the vast majority of the raw SV calls in all the different coverage datasets
               were non-somatic, on average 99.84% (range 99.81-99.9%, COLO829) and 99.55%
               (range 99.4-99.74%, HGS-3) (Figure 2A).


               In the high coverage Nanopore datasets, we validated 84 (91% of the short-read refer-
 5             ence set) and 219 (74% of the short-read reference set) true-positive somatic SVs for   5
               COLO829 and HGS-3, respectively, representing a small fraction of the total number of
               raw SV calls (Figure 2A and Suppl. Figure 2A). Similarly, we identified an average of 23
               (25% of the short-read reference set) and 53 (18% of the short-read reference set) somatic
               SV breakpoints in each of the low coverage Nanopore sequencing datasets for COLO829
               and HGS-3, respectively. (Figure 2A). Furthermore, we compared the performance of
               the SV callers NanoSV, Sniffles  and NanoVar . Thus, we show that based on lenient
                                        342
                                                      205
               SV calling of high- and low-coverage Nanopore sequencing data with NanoSV, somatic
               SVs can be identified.


               Enrichment for somatic SV calls from nanopore sequencing data


               Since the somatic SVs identified among the SV call sets of the Nanopore data represent
               only a small fraction of the total raw SV calls, we implemented a panel of cumulative
               filtering steps to enrich for somatic SVs. First, we selected only “PASS” SV calls (based on
               default NanoSV filter flags , Methods). Secondly, we excluded calls involving chromo-
                                     204
               some Y or the mitochondrial genome. Finally, we removed all insertions, since the exact
               inserted sequence cannot be accurately defined from low coverage nanopore sequencing
               data, thus hampering the final PCR assay development at a later step. As a result of these
               filtering steps, 72.6% (COLO829) and 76.2% (HGS-3) false-positive calls were removed
               in the high coverage sets (Figure 2B and Suppl. Table 2). For the low coverage sets, the
               filtering removed on average 50.9% (COLO829) and 49.9% (HGS-3) of false-positive
               calls (Figure 2B and Suppl. Table 2). In contrast, the vast majority of true-positive so-
               matic SV calls were maintained following SV filtering (on average 76.9% in COLO829
               and 93.9% in HGS-3, Figure 2B).


                                                                                       121]]></page><page Index="130"><![CDATA[CHAPTER 5




            To further reduce the number of false-positive SV calls, we employed a random forest
            (RF) machine learning approach (Methods), similarly as previously described for SV
            calling of nanopore data . We applied the RF classifier to the filtered high and low cov-
                                204
            erage subsets of COLO829 and HGS-3. For the high coverage sets, the RF labelled 84%
            (COLO829) and 81.3% (HGS-3) of false-positive SV calls as false (Figure 2C). For the
            low coverage sets, on average 70.6% (COLO829) and 68% (HGS-3) of false-positive SV
            calls were labelled as false (Figure 2C). In addition, in the high coverage sets, 81.25%
            (COLO829) and 97.88% (HGS-3) of true-positive somatic SV calls were labelled as true.
            Similar percentages of true-positive SV calls were labelled as true in the low coverage
            sets, on average 73.7% (COLO829) and 98.6% (HGS-3) (Figure 2C). These results show
            that the RF classifier filters out the majority of non-somatic breakpoints, while maintain-
            ing true-positive somatic SV calls. However, germline SV calls are also maintained at this
            step, requiring further filtering to enrich for somatic SVs (Suppl. Figure 2B).
     5      To reduce the number of germline SVs, we implemented a blacklist filtering step. There-                                                                                         5


            fore, the remaining SV calls were overlapped with two databases (DBFilter) as pan-
            el-of-normal (PON) filtering: (i) SharcDB, containing SV calls from nanopore sequenc-
            ing of 14 different samples , and (ii) RefDB, containing germline SV calls from 59 control
            samples previously sequenced using Illumina WGS in our group (Methods). Follow-
            ing this filtering step, 100% of true-positive somatic SV calls from both the COLO829
            and HGS-3 high and low coverage sets were retained (Figure 2D). In contrast, 88.6%
            (COLO829, high coverage), 76.2% (HGS-3, high coverage) and on average 89.9%
            (COLO829, low coverage) and 84.5% (HGS-3, low coverage) of remaining false-positive
            SV calls were filtered out (Figure 2D). Due to this filtering, the fraction of true-positive
            somatic breakpoints among the remaining SV calls increased to 6.6%-18.7%, for the low
            and high-coverage Nanopore datasets of COLO829 and HGS-3 (Figure 2E and Suppl.
            Figure 2A).

            To further enrich for somatic SVs, we implemented a ranking method, based on the ob-
            servation that large SVs are more likely to be somatic than germline SVs (Suppl. Figure
            4). This increased the percentage of true-positive somatic SVs to 85% (COLO829) and
            65% (HGS-3) in the high coverage sets, and to on average 43% (COLO829) and 64.1%
            (HGS-3) in the low coverage sets (Figure 2E).

            median value. RF: Random forest; DBFilter: Database filter.


            Altogether, our SV filtering pipeline strongly enriches for true-positive somatic break-
            points and filters out the majority of false-positives and germline SVs. We demonstrate
            a total enrichment of true-positive somatic SV calls from 0.1% in the raw calls to 85%
            in the final Top20 ranked calls (17/20, COLO829, high coverage), 0.26% to 65% (13/20,
            HGS-3, high coverage), on average 0.18% to 41.7% (8.3/20, COLO829, low coverage
            sets) and on average 0.49% to 64.2% (12.8/20, HGS-3, low coverage sets) (Figure 2F). Of
            note, despite low coverage sequencing, each of the somatic SV calls identifies breakpoints
     5      at nucleotide resolution, providing immediate access to breakpoint PCR testing.                                                                                                 5



            Validation in tumor tissue from patients with ovarian and prostate cancer



            Next, we tested the pipeline on four high-grade serous ovarian cancer (Ova1-4) and six
            prostate cancer (Pros1-6) samples. We sequenced tumor DNA on one nanopore flow
            cell per sample. The ovarian cancer samples and three prostate cancer samples (Pros1-3)
            were sequenced on commercial ONT flow cells. For the ovarian cancer samples, we start-
            ed library preparation with minimally 1 µg of DNA. For the prostate cancer samples lim-
            ited material was available, and we started library preparation with 250 ng of DNA. For
            one sample (Pros3), not enough sequencing data was produced to confidently detect so-
            matic SVs and this sample was therefore excluded from all subsequent analyses (Suppl.
            Table 1). Three additional prostate cancer samples (Pros4-6) were sequenced on ONT
            research prototype flow cells with higher sequencing sensitivity, thus requiring less DNA
            input material. In these cases, library preparation was started with an average of 108 ng
            (80-128 ng) of DNA and an average of 10 ng of library was loaded for sequencing (Suppl.
            Table 1). We obtained an average sequence coverage of 2.3x (range: 1.8 - 4.0) (Figure 3A
            and Suppl. Table 1) and average read lengths of 7.8 Kbp (range: 4.2-16.3 Kbp) (Figure
            3B and Suppl. Table 1). The sequencing throughput was not affected by the lower DNA
            input when using the high-sensitivity prototype flow cells. (Suppl. Table 1).
            Following the lenient SV calling, pre-filtering, RF classification, the database filtering and
            ranking steps, an average 2.8% (range of 1.0%-4.4%) of SVs per sample were retained
            (Figure 3C). We performed breakpoint PCR assays on lymphocyte and tumor DNA
            for the top 20 ranked SVs and validated an average of 10 (50%, range 25-80%) somatic

               SVs per sample (Figure 3D). Therefore, despite not having enough sequencing depth to
               provide a complete genome construction, we were able to identify several somatic SV
               biomarkers in each of the tumor samples.


               We investigated the recall of validated somatic SVs at different timepoints during the
               sequencing run. We found that, on average, 81.6% (range 50-100%) of validated somatic
               SVs were already detected within the first 24 hours of sequencing (Suppl. Figure 6). This
               offers the opportunity to reduce the sequencing time, accelerating tumor biomarker dis-
               covery with one day.

            Detection of somatic SVs in cfDNA from patients with ovarian and prostate cancer



            To show the applicability of the pipeline to detect clinically relevant biomarkers, we next
            tested if we could detect the validated somatic SVs in cfDNA of patients. Ascites fluid,
            which is known to contain cfDNA and ctDNA  was available for Ova2 at time of dis-
                                                   361
            ease recurrence. We extracted cfDNA from the ascites and tested the 16 validated so-
            matic SVs out of the Top20 by PCR. 100% of somatic SVs could be detected within the
            cfDNA from ascites (Suppl. Figure 7), and not in the germline or water controls. Next,
            we tested whether validated SVs could be detected in cfDNA from blood. Therefore,
            we selected two patient-specific SVs for four prostate cancer patients (Pros1, 4, 5 and 6)
            based on a high signal to noise ratio observed in qPCR assays for SV breakpoints (Figure
            4A and Methods).
            To enable sensitive and quantitative detection, we designed digital PCR (dPCR) assays
            for the eight selected SVs (Figure 4B). For each SV, we aimed to design a probe for both
     5      wild-type alleles (up- and downstream) and for the mutant allele (across the breakpoint                                                                                         5
            junction). For five SVs we could design an assay that quantified both the upstream and
            downstream wild-type allele. For the three other SVs, primers/probes for only one of
            the wild-type alleles were designed, as appropriate primer design for the other allele was
            hindered by repetitive sequences at the target site. As the amount of cfDNA within one
            liquid biopsy is limited, we used a conditional breakpoint detection approach: (i) if dPCR
            on pre-amplified cfDNA (input pre-amplification: 0.2-1 ng cfDNA) confirmed the pres-
            ence of the SV within cfDNA, (ii) then subsequent dPCR on non-preamplified cfDNA
            (stock cfDNA) (input dPCR: 5 ng cfDNA) was performed. The latter enabled calcula-
            tion of both the variant allele frequency (VAF) and the number of mutant molecules
            per milliliter plasma (MM/mL plasma). First, we selected two timepoints per patient,
            one at baseline and one at progression of disease and confirmed the presence of all eight
            SVs with dPCR on pre-amplified cfDNA (Suppl. Figure 8). Thereafter, dPCR on the
            stock cfDNA successfully detected all SVs in the four patients, both in baseline and pro-
            gression samples (Figure 4C and 4D). Despite the fact that the VAF in pre-amplified
            cfDNA correlates to the VAF in stock cfDNA (r = 0.928), they should be considered two
                                                  s
            separate outcome measurements (regression coefficient = 0.72 ≠ 1) (Suppl. Figure 9A).
            Moreover, VAF based on the wild-type upstream allele was highly similar to VAF based
            on the wild-type downstream allele in stock cfDNA (r = 0.996, regression coefficient =
                                                         s
            1.05) (Suppl. Figure 9B), suggesting no significant imbalances between the two sides of
            the breakpoint.

            Monitoring treatment response in patients with prostate cancer


            In addition to the detection of SVs in cfDNA at baseline and progression of disease, we
            explored the capacity to use SVs to monitor treatment response over time. To enable re-
            liable response monitoring, measurements should be accurate and repeatable. As VAFs
            are ratios and in principle not influenced by technical variations between timepoints, we
            chose to report VAFs only. To verify the accuracy of dPCR, we performed two technical
            replicates for all pre-amplified samples of Pros5 and Pros6 and confirmed a high correla-
            tion of VAFs between the replicates (r = 0.987, regression coefficient = 0.918) (Suppl.
                                            s
            Figure 9C). Finally, we quantified the eight SVs of the four prostate cancer patients in
            the longitudinally collected samples from before, during and after treatment. For Pros1,
            SV-A shows the potential to improve response evaluation as its dynamics correspond
            to the expected response to treatment with cabazitaxel and increases towards the end of
            treatment, resulting in the highest levels at clinical progression of disease (Figure 4E).
     5      These changes also seem to correlate with other blood biomarkers, including PSA and                                                                                             5
            ALP. In addition, SV-B in Pros1 similarly correlates with response to treatment (Figure
            4E). Also for Pros5 both SV-A and SV-B show clear changes over time correlating with
            clinical parameters, and Pros4 and Pros6 have less compelling dynamics of the detected
            SVs (Suppl. Figure 10A-C).




            Discussion


            Recent studies have utilized somatic SVs for tracking tumor burden from liquid biop-
            sies 69,165,166,357 . Although these studies showed the potential of this methodology, they
            lacked sufficient turn-around time to provide personalized biomarkers before the ini-
            tiation of patient treatment. This is due to lengthy short-read WGS approaches for SV
            detection and an associated substantial number of false-positive somatic SVs, requiring
            laborious testing to validate SVs. To overcome these limitations, we utilized the real-time
            and long-read capabilities of nanopore sequencing combined with a machine learning
            approach to efficiently identify a set of somatic SVs from tumor tissue within three days.
            The rapid and simple workflow offers great potential for routine monitoring of cancer
            dynamics. We illustrate the applicability of our method to measure tumor burden by
            using a series of longitudinally gathered blood samples from metastatic prostate cancer
            patients.
            Obtaining enough tumor material for DNA isolation is often a limiting factor for
            next-generation sequencing assays. We show that nanopore sequencing and somatic SV
            detection is possible from limited amounts of DNA that can be extracted from a meta-
            static tumor needle biopsy, which is an important requisite for clinical viability. DNA in-

               put can be decreased even further to as little as 80 ng when using flow cells with increased
               sensitivity for DNA (research prototype flow cells provided by ONT).
               Long-read sequencing is an excellent method for the detection of SVs at nucleotide
               resolution, even at low sequencing depth, because each long-read that bridges a break-
                                                                                    204
               point-junction provides direct information on the breakpoint position and sequence  .
               Sequencing of a tumor sample on a single GridION/MinION nanopore flow cell gen-
               erates insufficient sequencing data to accurately establish a complete genomic profile.
               However, using the pipeline developed here, we efficiently enriched for patient-specific
               somatic SV events - irrespective of their functional impact on tumor biology. Despite the
               very low coverage, the computational method functions independently of correspond-
               ing germline sequencing data. These assets make our pipeline a cost-efficient assay for
               detection of personalized somatic SV biomarkers. Furthermore, on average 50% of the
               detected SVs are somatic, which minimizes the hands-on effort needed for validation
               purposes. For all analyzed tumors, we identified at least five somatic SV biomarkers per
 5             patient, an amount within the range of biomarkers used to trace ctDNA in previous   5
               work
                         . With expected increases in sequencing throughput from ONT sequencing,
                   69,166,362
               the performance of the pipeline will improve significantly. Furthermore, the use of cheap
               disposable flow cells (Flongle) could reduce assay costs to  /5 of the current sequencing
                                                               1
               price of 800€  . The minimal costs of this assay would enable the broader application of
                          363
               such individualized SV monitoring in cancer patients.
               We retrospectively traced levels of ctDNA with two SVs per patient for four prostate can-
               cer patients and compared tumor dynamics to clinical biomarkers such as PSA and ALP.
               The quantitative measurement of SVs in ctDNA suggests that VAFs of SVs correlate with
               tumor load (Pros1 and Pros5). Moreover, the SVs would have indicated progression of
               disease earlier than PSA did in some patients (Pros1 and Pros 4). Even though we only
               tested two SVs per patient, this clearly illustrates the potential clinical utility of quanti-
               fying ctDNA with SVs to monitor response to treatment. The assay could be optimized
               by not only identifying the tumor-specific SVs, but also SVs that represent the dominant
               disease clone and upcoming, targetable subclones. In addition, larger prospective studies
               should confirm that indeed measuring SVs improves clinical decision making in patients
               with metastatic prostate, and other cancer types.



               Conclusions


               Clinicians are well aware of the dynamic response of cancer to treatment but lack the
               tools to monitor these changes in real-time and thus generally respond to alterations too
               late for true treatment success. We present a method to overcome these limitations and
               provide a solution to immediate individualized disease monitoring. This approach could

               Benchmarking somatic SV calling from low coverage nanopore sequencing data:
               Nanopore data from COLO829 was randomly subsampled to 5x sequencing coverage
               three times independently with Sambamba . SV calling was performed with NanoSV

               SV calling and filtering pipeline: The SHARC pipeline is available through https://github.
               com/UMCUGenetics/SHARC. Mapping is performed in parallel for each FASTQ file by
                                    344
               using minimap2 (v. 2.12)  with settings “-x map-ont -a --MD”. The reference genome
               used is version GRCh37. Sorting and merging of BAM files was done by using sambam-
               ba (v. 0.6.5) . SV calling was performed by using NanoSV (v. 1.1.2) . Default NanoSV
                                                                      204
                        345
               settings were used except a minimum read count of 2 (cluster_count=2) and minimum
               mapping quality of 20 (min_mapq=20). VCFs are filtered by using the command `awk
               ‘$7 == “PASS” && $1 !~ /(Y|MT)/ && $5 !~ /(Y|MT):/ && $5 != “<INS>”’` to select
               PASS calls and remove insertions and SVs involving chromosomes Y or MT. VCFs are
               then annotated with the distance to the closest single repeat element in the reference ge-
               nome 366,367 , the closest gap element in the reference genome 367,368 , and the closest segmen-

               tal duplication element in the reference genome . These elements were taken from the

               UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu) , using the GRCh37/hg19 genome
               version.
               We trained a random forest (RF) model to filter out false-positive SV calls from nanopore

               data, similarly as previously described . We expanded the selection of input features for
               the RF, by including read length, SV calling features, and overlap with repeat features in
               the reference genome (Suppl. Table 3). We trained the classifier on the well-character-

            quencing. The GIAB SV truth set was generated by intersecting these three GIAB SV sets
            resulting in a set of 1,515 germline SVs. We used ⅔ of the GIAB truth set as a training set
            and ⅓ as a test set. We established a precision-recall curve from 100 bootstrapping runs
            (Suppl. Figure 4), where the training data were split into 90%-10% train-test subsets.
            Based on the precision-recall curve, we defined an operating point of 96% precision and
            99.5% recall (Suppl. Figure 4). The final model was then re-trained on the whole train-
            ing set and tested on the ⅓ test set. The performance on the test set was 95.1% precision
            and 99.6% recall, representing an accuracy of 97.2% (Suppl. Figure 4). SV candidates are
            classified as “true” or “false” based on this RF model.
            We set up two databases of SV calls: (i) SharcDB: containing raw NanoSV calls from
            nanopore sequencing data of 14 samples, 11 of which belong to this study (COLO829,
            HGS-3, Ova1, Ova2, Ova3, Ova4, Pros1, Pros2, Pros4, Pros5 and Pros6; and three more
            for which we had SV calls from high coverage nanopore data: COLO829BL (lympho-
            blastoid cell line, 50x sequencing depth), VCAP (prostate cancer cell line ) and the Ge-
                                                                       371

                     350
            ta (v. 1.0.3)  with default parameters and 40 healthy individuals (biological parents of
            individuals with congenital abnormalities)  where germline SVs were called with Man-
                                               372
                       350
            ta (v. 0.29.5)  with default parameters.SV calls from tumor samples are overlapped
            with those two databases by using VCF-explorer (https://github.com/UMCUGenetics/
            vcf-explorer). Only samples classified as “true” by the RF model and that do not overlap
            with any sample in the databases qualify for primer design. Primer design for filtered
            SV calls is automatized by using Primer3 (v. 1.1.4)  with a product size range of 30-230
                                                     349
            bp. SVs with a successful primer design are ranked based on SV length and the 20 larg-
            est are selected for PCR validation. Insertions are filtered out early in the pipeline since
            the inserted sequence cannot be accurately inferred from the low coverage nanopore se-
            quencing data. Inter-chromosomal translocations are not present in the top20 ranked
            SVs because the final ranking is based on SV size and this cannot be determined for
            inter-chromosomal SVs. However they are available in the final VCF file and primers
            are designed by default, so they can be manually selected for PCR validation and assay
            development.

            Breakpoint PCR: To validate SVs, breakpoint PCR with AmpliTaqGold (Applied Bio-
            systems) was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 10 ng primary tumor
            DNA (somatic) and 10 ng lymphocyte DNA (germline) per primer-pair were used as
            input. PCR products were loaded and visualized on a 2% agarose gel.

               quantified by Qubit  fluorometric quantitation (Invitrogen).
               Quantitative PCR: As primer specificity is essential for reliable interpretation of an end-
               point assay like dPCR, primers for the detection of structural variants were validated
               by quantitative PCR (qPCR) on whole genome amplified (WGA) tumor and germline
               DNA. In brief, qPCR was performed by using the CFX96 Touch™ Real-Time PCR De-
               tection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and the final reaction mix consisted of 10 µL Sen-
 5             siFAST  SYBR ® Lo-Rox mix (Bioline), 0.5 µM forward and reverse primers, 10 ng of   5

               20 µL. The Cycle conditions were as follows: 14 cycles of 10s at 95°C and 30s at from 65-
               58°C (touchdown), followed by 20-40 cycles of 10s at 95°C and 30s at 60°C. In addition,
               a melt curve was generated from 56°C to 95°C to assess the generated PCR products.
               Based on qPCR results, two primer sets for the detection of SVs in each patient were
               selected for quantification by digital PCR (dPCR). Primer sets were excluded from use
               with dPCR when one of the following ocurred: >1 PCR product, Cq germline - Cq tumor  <5
               and/or Cq   > 20.

               DNA sonication and fragment size analysis: To mimic the length of cfDNA and improve
               DNA molecule partition, WGA DNA of both tumor and germline were sonicated to a
               peak size of ~150 bp with the S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris) according to the
               manufacturer’s protocol. The sonication conditions were as follows; 200-250 ng WGA
               DNA (concentration determined by Qubit  fluorometric quantitation) in 50 µL Ultra-

            Illumina data from the CPCT-02 study (Pros1, Pros4, Pros5 and Pros6), but Sanger se-
            quencing of the particular qPCR product could be used as well. To enable quantification
            of both mutant and wild-type alleles, additional primers for the detection of wild-type
            upstream (WT-U) allele and wild-type downstream (WT-D) allele of the breakpoint and
            fluorescent probes for both mutant and wild-type alleles were developed by using the
            Primer Express Software v3.0 (ThermoFisher) and the online tool Primer3Plus . All

            primers and fluorescent probes (Suppl. Table 4) were ordered from Eurogentec.


            Pre-amplification of cfDNA: To enable sensitive detection of multiple SVs in limited
            amounts of cfDNA, two SVs per patient were pre-amplified with 0.2-1 ng of cfDNA.
            Pre-amplified tumor and germline DNA samples were used as respectively positive and
            negative control. Pre-amplification was performed by using 4 µL of TaqMan™ PreAmp
            Master Mix (cat.no: 4488593, Life Technologies), 2 µL primer pool (0.25 µM) consist-
            ing of SV forward (SV-F) and reverse (SV-R) primers and upstream (WT-U) and down-

            21,357, inter quartile range 19,837-22,736. dPCR reactions were optimized with 10 ng
            sonicated tumor and germline WGA DNA. When an SV could be detected in pre-am-
            plified cfDNA samples, a dPCR of all longitudinal cfDNA samples was performed on 5
            ng of stock (no pre-amplification) cfDNA to enable absolute quantification of mutant

               Technologies). Thresholds for positive fluorescence were determined per primer pair
               based on positive and negative controls. Variant allele frequency (VAF) was calculated
               according to the following formula:
               number of mutant molecules per µl in chip (as defined by Crystal Miner™ software) /
               (number of mutant molecules per µl in chip + number of wild-type molecules per µl in
               chip) * 100%.
               Absolute number of mutant molecules per mL plasma was calculated as follows:
               number of mutant molecules per µl in chip * 28 µl (input in chip) / (used eluate/total
               volume of eluate * volume of plasma used for isolation).
               To correct for zero values on a log scale, +1 was counted to every value and axes were
               corrected with -1. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was calculated for comparisons of
               VAF based on upstream wild-type allele vs downstream wild-type allele, two replicates
               and pre-amplified vs non-pre-amplified cfDNA samples. Corresponding slope was cal-
               culated by using linear regression analysis.

               Tumor samples of four patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (OC) and six pa-
               tients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (PC) were used in this study.
               Patients with OC participated in the HUB-OVI study, in which tumor tissue and blood
               were obtained for organoid culture (tumor) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) (tu-
               mor and blood). Clinical data was extracted from the patient file in collaboration with
               the Dutch Cancer Registration. Patients with PC participated in both the CPCT-02 study
               (NCT01855477) and the CIRCUS study (NTR5732), in which tumor tissue from a met-
               astatic lesion for WGS and longitudinal cfDNA samples were obtained. Longitudinal
               ctDNA quantification was performed for four patients with PC. Informed consent was
               obtained within all studies. Clinical data for patients with PC were collected in an elec-
               tronic case report form (ALEA Clinical). All studies were performed according to the
               guidelines of the European Network of Research Ethics Committees (EUREC) following
               European, national and local law.

               for subsampled Nanopore sequencing datasets from COLO829 and HGS-3. For each level of coverage, 20
               independent subsampled datasets were generated and subjected to each filtering step in a cumulative manner.

               for both COLO829 and HGS-3. The percentage of somatic and non-somatic SV calls is calculated relative
               to the sum of remaining somatic and non-somatic SV calls after each filtering step. Thus, 100% represents
               the total number of SV calls (somatic plus non-somatic) present at each step. (B) This figure panel is based
               on the same underlying data as for panel A, but here the percentage of somatic (blue) and non-somatic (red)
               SV calls is plotted relative to the total number of somatic and non-somatic SV calls detected at the first step,
               respectively. Thus, 100% represents the total number of non-somatic or somatic SV calls found initially in
               the raw data prior to filtering. While the percentage of non-somatic SV calls (red line/dots) decreases rapidly

               Abstract



               Pediatric leukemias are aggressive tumors and therefore require immediate diagnosis,
               treatment initiation and appropriate biomarkers to facilitate minimal residual disease
               (MRD) tracing. The occurrence of genomic rearrangements such as fusion genes are
               hallmark events in these cancers and their unique genomic breakpoint junctions serve as
               an attractive MRD biomarker. Furthermore, leukemic cells derived from the lymphoid
               lineage (e.g. ALL and CLL) harbor clonal variable (V), diversity, (D), joining (J) rear-
               rangements in the immunoglobulin (Ig) and/or T-cell receptors (TCR) which are widely
               used for PCR-based MRD tracing approaches. Timely detection of the exact genomic
               breakpoint junction of the fusion genes and/or the dominant V(D)J clones is therefore
               essential; however, this often presents as a race against the clock with current multi-step
               diagnostic processes. We here applied FUDGE -a targeted long-read nanopore sequenc-
               ing assay- to a panel of ten KMT2A or SIL-TAL1 fusion-positive acute lymphoid leu-
               kemia samples. We show that we can comprehensively target and obtain high coverage
               across the two fusion loci as well as the complex Ig and TCR loci with a single sequenc-
               ing run. Within 48 hours we validate 86% of the diagnostically defined MRD targets for
 6             these patients. Furthermore, we identify an additional set of patient-specific rearrange-  6

               ments that could be used for MRD tracing. We here utilize FUDGE to detect unique
               genomic breakpoint junctions in pediatric lymphoid leukemia samples and present it
               as an attractive alternative to current multi-step biomarker identification assays for an
               increase in speed and detection sensitivity.

            Introduction



            Leukemias are the most common form of pediatric cancers and account for approxi-
            mately 30% of childhood cancer incidences . Leukemias develop from hematopoietic
                                                375
            progenitors in the bone marrow or the thymus and cause an abnormal increase of white
            blood cells . Depending on the type of affected lineage (myeloid or lymphoid) and the
                     376
            kinetics of the disease (acute or chronic), leukemias can be subdivided into acute my-
            eloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia
            (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). These subtypes can be further subdi-
            vided based on molecular abnormalities or immunophenotypic presentation and pres-
            ent with differing prognostic predictions 377,378 . While the overall survival rate of pediatric
            leukemias has drastically increased over the past decades, with 90% for ALL and 75%
            for AML, refractory or relapsed patients still face poor prognosis, therefore requiring
            accurate diagnosis at initial presentation as well as at recurrence 377,379 . Key to the man-
            agement of leukemias is monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) – small traces
            of leukemic cells that can still be detected by sensitive methods like flow cytometry or
                380
            PCR . MRD is a strong prognostic factor widely used for risk group stratification and
     6      other clinical decision-making 381,382 . Molecular MRD monitoring relies on genetic mark-                                                                                       6
            ers that specifically identify the leukemic cells. Genetic abnormalities such as the unique
            breakpoint junctions created by genomic rearrangements are optimal biomarkers that
            reflect the disease burden 69,166 .


            A large proportion of leukemic subtypes are characterized by recurrent genomic rear-
            rangements which may lead to the formation of fusion genes 383,31 . Fusion gene formation
            is a complex mechanism and the originating fusion gene configurations are extreme-
            ly versatile. Whereas some events involve highly recurrent fusion gene configurations,
            such as the common BCR-ABL1 fusion or the rare SIL-TAL1 deletion rearrangement,
            others mainly involve a sole recurrent fusion partner gene 384–386 . KMT2A for example,
            is a promiscuous fusion partner gene and has been reported in >130 different fusion
            configurations 387,388 . Additionally, the genomic position where the break occurs within
            the involved genes is very variable - even for highly recurrent fusion gene configurations.
            However, this high level of versatility results in unique genomic breakpoint junctions, an
            acquired and patient-specific property of the tumor cells, and can therefore be exploited
            as a distinct, trackable biomarker.

            Leukemias that arise from the lymphoid lineage mainly comprise a clonal outgrowth of
                                       389
            single transformed lymphoblasts . Lymphoblasts are immature lymphocytes that will
            become the effectors of the adaptive immune system, which recognizes millions or bil-
            lions of different antigens thanks to a highly diverse repertoire of antigen recognition

               molecules on B- and T- cells 390,391 . This antigen receptor repertoire is generated during
               their maturation by the unique process of the variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J) re-
               combination, a somatic recombination at the genetic level during which different gene
               segments rearrange . This process, taken together with random nucleotide insertions
                               392
               and deletions at the joint sites (junctional diversity), provides a highly diverse repertoire
               of immunoglobulins (Igs) in B-cells and T-cell receptors (TCRs) in T-cells 393,394 . The re-
               sults at the genomic level are newly formed and unique genomic junctions which con-
               nect the rearranged V(D)J segments, and ultimately form the unique antigen binding do-
               mains of the antigen receptor proteins. Depending on the developmental stage at which
               lymphoblasts undergo malignant transformation, they usually have already undergone
               one or more successive VDJ recombination events and thus harbor one or more unique
               rearrangements in their DNA: fingerprints of the leukemic cells that can be exploited as
                                                395
               molecular markers for MRD monitoring .
               Biomarkers for MRD assays must be patient specific and are therefore often based on the
                                                                396
               unique properties of the underlying genomic rearrangement . Fusion genes can easily
               be detected by breakpoint-spanning primers (i.e. one primer upstream and one primer
 6             downstream of the breakpoint junction), while Ig/TCR rearrangements require a break-  6
               point-specific primer (i.e. one primer sitting on the breakpoint junction) combined with
               a germline probe and primer to ensure increased specificity 396,397 . Quantifications are
               usually performed with PCR-based assays, and return information on the effectiveness
               of the treatment as well as tumor dynamics 396,398 . Furthermore, the tumor material can be
               obtained through liquid biopsies (i.e. blood) in a minimal invasive manner. Hence, not
               only MRD but also therapy response can be effectively assessed in a longitudinal fashion.
               Current diagnostic approaches to identify MRD targets mainly include PCR-based as-
               says, targeted NGS or WGS/RNA-Seq 399,400 . Routine DNA-breakpoint PCRs have been
               developed for the Ig/TCR rearrangements, however, for some labs no standardized as-
               says are available for versatile fusion events like KMT2A fusions or even the recurrent
               configurations such as the SIL-TAL1 rearrangement. For the majority of recurrent fu-
               sion events transcriptomic breakpoints are utilized as the breakpoint detection is simpli-
               fied through its restriction to exon-exon junctions and predeveloped probes can ensure
               high quality detection and quantification assays . While a transcriptomic breakpoint
                                                       401
               may be less representative of the actual number of leukemic cells, their simple and reli-
               able methodology and rapid turnaround time has made them a standardized diagnostic
               assay. (Targeted) NGS approaches are now being implemented in diagnostic labs due to
               their mostly unbiased ability to detect fusion genes at the RNA or DNA level, however,
               these come with more complex analysis strategies, validation requirements and longer
               turnaround times . Furthermore, RNA-Seq is not suited to detect promoter fusions
                              399
                                                           402

            would comprehensively identify genomic MRD targets from fusion genes and Ig/TCR
            loci, in a rapid (e.g. less than one week), comprehensive and straightforward workflow
            with minimal hands-on time requirements.


            We recently developed FUDGE -a targeted and directional nanopore sequencing as-

            a nanopore sequencing assay ideally suited for the detection of personalized genomic
            MRD targets from gene fusions and Ig/TCR rearrangements in lymphoid leukemias. We
            retrospectively tested a panel of five KMT2A positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leuke-
            mias (B-ALL) and five SIL-TAL1 positive T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)
            samples. We show the capability of the assay to comprehensively target fusion genes as
            well as the Ig and TCR loci and to detect the sequence of genomic breakpoints for use
            in the subsequent design of MRD assays. We confirm 86% of the MRD targets that were
            diagnostically determined for these patients and identify an additional 32 potential pa-
            tient-specific MRD targets - all within 48 hours.

            KMT2A and SIL-TAL1 assay design


                                         403
            We previously developed FUDGE , a targeted and directional nanopore sequencing
            assay,  to  identify  recurrent  fusion  genes  irrespective  of  fusion  partner  and  genomic
            breakpoint position. We here apply FUDGE to a panel of KMT2A and SIL-TAL1 fu-
            sion-positive B-ALL and T-ALL patient samples, respectively, to identify unique ge-
            nomic breakpoint junctions which may serve as suitable biomarkers for subsequent
            quantitative PCR-based MRD testing with breakpoint-spanning primers (Figure 1A).
            FUDGE couples target-selected and strand-specific CRISPR/Cas9 activity, which fa-
            cilitates  enrichment by selective sequencing adapter  ligation, to  long-read real-time
            nanopore sequencing (Supplementary Figure 1). KMT2A, a recurrent fusion partner
            gene in leukemias, has been reported with >130 different fusion gene configurations.
            Furthermore, there are two clusters within the KMT2A gene spanning approximatively
                                                          387
            12.4 kb where previous breakpoints have been reported . Therefore, we designed two
            crRNAs (crK-e7 and crK-e19) targeting these two main breakpoint clusters (Figure 1B).
            SIL-TAL1, a specific and recurrent rearrangement between SIL and TAL1 adjacently lo-
            cated on chromosome 1, is induced through a site-specific deletion between the genes
            of approximately 85 kb or chromosomal translocations in approximately 20% of T-ALL
            patients . To identify the exact genomic breakpoint location, we designed two crRNAs

               KMT2A and SIL-TAL1 detection


               To validate our assay design, we sequenced ten acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples:
               five B-ALL (B-ALL1, B-ALL2, B-ALL3, B-ALL4, and B-ALL5) and five T-ALL (T-ALL1,
               T-ALL2, T-ALL3, T-ALL4, and T-ALL5). For the B-ALL1 and B-ALL2 samples, previ-
               ous diagnostic efforts identified KMT2A-MLLT1 fusions, however, for B-ALL1 the fu-
               sion could only be detected by RNA-sequencing, but could not be validated by PCR.
               For samples B-ALL3, B-ALL4, and B-ALL5 we performed a blinded analysis and did
               not know the fusion partner before our analysis. For all five T-ALL samples SIL-TAL1
               rearrangements were detected by heteroduplex analysis.

            We performed target enrichment for each sample with appropriate sets of crRNAs (Sup-
            plementary Table 1) and sequenced each sample on one Oxford Nanopore Technolo-
            gies MinION flow cell (R9.4). After mapping to the reference genome (GRCh38), the ge-
            nome wide coverage per sample was 0.028x (B-ALL1), 0.04x (B-ALL2), 0.10x (B-ALL3),
            0.54x (B-ALL4), 0.67x (B-ALL5), 0.22x (T-ALL1), 0.17x (T-ALL2), 0.032x (T-ALL3),
            0.12x (T-ALL4) and 0.037x (T-ALL5) (Supplementary Table 1). However, due to the
            targeted sequencing approach, on-target coverages increased to 2-352x for the KMT2A
            locus in the B-ALL samples and 47-290x at the SIL and TAL1 loci in the T-ALL samples.
            (Figure 2A and Supplementary Table 1).
            To detect KMT2A fusion genes we applied NanoFG, which we previously developed to
            identify fusion genes from nanopore sequencing data . NanoFG identified, as expected,

            (Supplementary Table 2). For the blinded samples B-ALL3 and B-ALL5 we identified
            a KMT2A-MLLT2 fusion with four and 31 fusion-supporting reads respectively, which
            was later confirmed by comparison with outsourced results obtained from a laboratory
            specializing in KMT2A partner detection. In addition to this fusion result, a reciprocal
            MLLT2-KMT2A fusion was detected in the B-ALL5 sample with 28 fusion-supporting
            reads that was not previously detected (Supplementary Figure 2, Supplementary Table
            2). For B-ALL4, the diagnostic laboratory identified a KMT2A-MLLT2 fusion, howev-

            this fusion within our targeted sequencing data. In accordance with diagnostic efforts,
            NanoFG did not identify genomic evidence of the KMT2A fusion for the B-ALL1 sam-
            ple. We manually confirmed the lack of fusion-spanning reads within the KMT2A and
            MLLT1 genes with IGV. NanoFG is specifically designed to detect fusion genes with
            breakpoints within both of the involved fusion partners.
            Therefore, NanoFG did not call any of the SIL-TAL1 rearrangements within the T-ALL
            samples as the  SIL-TAL1  rearrangement may be induced through breakpoints out-
            side of annotated genes (including promoter, both UTRs, and exonic/intronic regions).
            Therefore, we performed SV calling with Sniffles  within the SIL and TAL1 loci. We

            50x (T-ALL3), 177x (T-ALL4) and 49x (T-ALL5) breakpoint-spanning reads (Figure
            2B, Supplementary Table 2). While the breakpoints within SIL were located within the
            5’UTR of the gene, all breakpoints within TAL1 were located about 185 bps upstream

               Ig and TCR loci assay design


               Lymphocytic leukemias are clonal amplifications of cells derived from the lymphoid lin-
               eage, and therefore harbor unique and clonal V(D)J rearrangements. We exploited this
               feature to detect additional MRD targets. For this reason, in addition to targeting the
               KMT2A and SIL/TAL1 loci, we comprehensively targeted the Ig (IGH, IGK, IGL) and
               TCR (TRA, TRB, TRD, TRG) loci. Each locus harbors a specific number of V, (D), and J
               segments (except IGK, IGL, TRA, and TRG which do not contain D segments) . These
                                                                               406

            ic regions (range: 130 kb - 1.4 Mb). However, during genomic somatic recombination,
            one V, (D), and J segment are juxtaposed, forming a unique rearrangement comprising
            a random amount of nucleotide insertions and deletions at the junction (Figure 3A).
            Post-recombination, these V(D)J rearrangements not only encompass a much smaller
            genomic region through the removal of intermediate gene segments but also form spe-
            cific breakpoint junctions which can be targeted by breakpoint-specific PCR assays (Fig-
            ure 3B) . We aimed to identify the unique breakpoint junctions within these loci as well
                   396
            as the predominant clonal V(D)J rearrangements per patient by covering the genomic
            area from the last J segment until the first D/V segment (Figure 3A). To accomplish this,
            crRNAs selectively directing sequencing reads from the last J segment towards the first
            D/V segment were designed (Figure 3C-3I). Since some of these genomic areas are large
            (up to 70 kbs between the first and last J segment), sequencing reads (average ~10 kb)
            originating from a cut adjacent to the last J segment will not reach the first D/V segment.
            For these instances we applied a tiled crRNA approach , targeting these loci every ~8
                                                         403
            kb, facilitating uniform coverage across the targeted loci (Figure 3E-I). Furthermore, the
            IGK locus can undergo consecutive rearrangements involving the intron RSS and Kde-
                               407
            letion (Kdel) segments . Depending on the state of rearrangement, the Kdel is too far
     6      from the J segments (Figure 3D, IGK(1)) or within reach (Figure 3D, IGK(2)), requiring                                                                                          6

            To validate that we can perform targeted sequencing of multiple Ig and TCR loci, we
            targeted the ten leukemia samples - in addition to the KMT2A and SIL-TAL1 loci - si-
            multaneously with crRNAs for the Ig and TCR loci (Figure 3C-I and Supplementary
            Table 1). B-ALL1, B-ALL2 and T-ALL1 were targeted with the fusion crRNAs as well as
            the IGH, IGK, IGL, TRB and TRG crRNAs (Supplementary Table 1). B-ALL3, B-ALL4,
            B-ALL5, T-ALL2, T-ALL3, T-ALL4 and T-ALL5 were additionally targeted with crRNAs
            for the TRA and TRD loci, a total of 25 crRNAs per sample, providing examples of par-
            allel fusion and comprehensive Ig/TCR sequencing.
            The average per-base coverage for all samples at the different Ig and TCR loci was 0.83x
            (IGH), 0.62x (IGK), 5.97x (IGL), 10.4x (TRA), 3.39x (TRB), 2.77x (TRD), and 10.60x
            (TRG) (Supplementary Table 1). We observed a sharp increase of coverage at the cut
     6      sites (Figure 4). For the IGH, IGK and TRG loci, where we only target with one crRNA                                                                                            6
            adjacent to the last J segment or the crRNAs were spaced far apart, we observe reads
            longer than 20 kb (Figure 4A-B and F). Noteworthy, the utilized DNA was not specifi-
            cally isolated for long-read sequencing approaches, and thus, these read lengths could be
            pushed even longer by applying appropriate extraction methods. For the IGK, IGL, TRA,
            TRB, TRD and TRG we clearly observe the effectiveness of the tiled crRNA approach to
            cover the entire loci (Figure 4B-F). For TRA, we are able to span a 60 kb window with
            eight consecutive crRNAs (Figure 4D). Visual investigation of the coverage plots already
            identifies large scale rearrangements events, e.g. by the observed drop in coverage in be-
            tween crRNA cut-sites (Figure 4E-F). The average coverage at the cut-sites in the Ig and
            TCR loci varies from 19x to 230x between the different loci (Supplementary Table 1),
            which could be due to underlying biological factors or the efficiency of the crRNAs. We
            also observe differences in coverages at the cut sites within one locus (e.g. TRA), which
            would support a theory that crRNA efficiency drastically influences the enrichment ca-
            pabilities. However, investigating the relationship between coverage at the cut-site and
            on/off-target scores of the crRNAs as provided by IDT , doesn’t show an obvious in-
                                                         408
            fluence of crRNA efficiency on the coverage (Supplementary Figure 3A and 3B). We
            do observe a correlation between sequencing throughput and coverage at the cut sites,
            indicating that a minimal sequencing throughput may be required for a successful en-
            richment (Supplementary Figure 3C).
            Taken together, these data show that we are able to comprehensively target fusion genes
            and Ig as well as TCR loci in one MinION sequencing run. With the tiled crRNA design

               investigation of genomic rearrangements within these loci.



               MRD target detection


               To validate that we can identify unique genomic breakpoint junctions from the enriched
               nanopore sequencing data, we collected diagnostic information about the 36 MRD tar-
               gets there were utilized for these patients (Table 1). These targets included both gene
               fusions and Ig/TCR rearrangements. We implemented a bioinformatic pipeline to auto-
               matically detect breakpoint junctions within the fused genes as well as the Ig/TCR loci.
               As the detection of the KMT2A and SIL-TAL1 fusion is already provided by NanoFG
               and Sniffles, respectively, we focussed on the detection of MRD targets within the Ig and
               TCR loci. For this, we extracted all reads falling within the genomic loci of the Ig and
               TCR loci and performed SV calling independently for each locus. We performed break-
               point-spanning PCRs on the detected breakpoints, using the corresponding tumor sam-
               ple and a polyclonal healthy donor as control sample. This resulted in a PCR product in
 6             97 out of the 140 assays (69%), highlighting the ability of our approach to identify Ig and   6
               TCR rearrangements from enriched nanopore sequencing data. However, we observed
               a PCR product for the control sample as well as the tumor sample in the majority of the
               cases. This was to be expected as we perform, in this step, an endpoint PCR assay without
               the use of a breakpoint-specific probe to select patient-specific clonal rearrangements.
               Furthermore, the control sample consists of a mixture of several healthy donor buffy
               coats, providing a rich background of possible rearrangements. In 38 (39%) of these
               cases, however, the amplification band in the tumor sample displayed a distinct pattern
               compared to the control sample, which presented a shifted size, lower intensity or smear,
               indicating a higher specificity of the primer to the tumor rearrangement (Supplemental
               Figure 4).
               We then annotated the resulting SVs with the genomic location of the different Ig/TCR
               genes. Through this approach, we found evidence of 31/36 (86.1%) of the MRD targets
               used in diagnostics for these patients (Table 1). For the five remaining targets, two lacked
               any evidence for the rearrangement while two other targets had only a single read sup-
               porting the target, insufficient for SV detection (Table 1). Interestingly, for the remaining
               rearrangement, diagnostic documentation reported a DH3.10-JH2 rearrangement in
               the B-ALL5 sample. Our long-read sequencing data did not provide proof of this specific
               connection, however, instead reporting multiple connections between DH3.10 and JH4
               as well as an inversion between JH4 and JH2 with the same supporting reads, indicating
               a more complex rearrangement than originally assumed by short-read NGS (Supple-
               mentary Figure 5). In addition to the MRD targets already used by diagnostics, we were

               To further validate the rearrangements detected with our method, we performed Sanger
               sequencing of 16 selected rearrangements based on one of the following criteria: diag-
               nostic Ig/TCR MRD target, read support ≥ 10, breakpoints connecting two V,D or J seg-
               ments or a clear difference in breakpoint-PCR between the tumor and control sample.
               In parallel, we performed consensus calling on the nanopore reads to obtain the accurate
               sequence at the breakpoint junctions. In 8 cases (50%), consensus calling was not suc-
               cessful, of which 6 could be traced back to insufficiently low read support. In the other
               half where we obtained consensus, in 2 cases (25%) of cases we obtained a single consen-
               sus sequence whereas in 75% (6/8) of the cases, multiple consensus sequences were gen-
               erated. When aligning the results from the Sanger sequencing to the nanopore consensus
               reads we observed a 100% match in 31% (4/13), one mismatch in 23%, (3/13) and two
               or more mismatches in 46% (6/13) of the cases. Taken together, this data shows that our
               targeted sequencing approach of Ig and TCR loci validated 86% of previously validated
               MRD targets and identifies an additional set of 32 PCR-validated rearrangements for
               potential MRD tracing in this cohort. However, verification of the exact sequence at the
 6             breakpoint by Sanger sequencing is still a requirement, especially in cases where rear-  6
               rangements show a low read support by nanopore sequencing.

               The time window from the start of the sequencing library preparation to obtaining the
               raw data was a maximum of 48 hours. Subsequently, bioinformatic detection of fusion
               genes and genomic breakpoints  of Ig and TCR rearrangements  including  mapping,
               SV calling and automated primer design was performed in less than 3 hours. Thereaf-
               ter, PCR assays and subsequent Sanger sequencing to obtain the accurate sequence at
               the breakpoint junction for junction-specific primer design are necessary, which in our
               hands could be performed in 72 hours until sequences were obtained. Hence, depending
               on the speed of the primer delivery, sequencing data for subsequent MRD assay design
               could be ready available after five days of sample obtention.

               Discussion



               Timely detection of patient and leukemia-specific biomarkers to monitor treatment re-
               sponse and MRD is key for pediatric leukemia patients 380,396 . Currently, these biomarkers
               mainly entail transcriptomic breakpoint junctions for recurrent fusion genes or genomic
               breakpoint junctions for Ig and TCR rearrangements 395,401 . While the identification of
               transcriptomic breakpoint junctions has been long established and widely used for MRD
               targets, the use of e.g. cDNA-based biomarkers is suboptimal for accurate assessment of
               tumor cell quantifications. Furthermore, current techniques to detect genomic break-
               point junctions, especially for the complex Ig and TCR rearrangements, are laborious,
                                               410
               and often involve multi-step protocols . Following the detection of appropriate MRD
               targets, patient-specific PCR assays need to be developed, another time-consuming ef-
                                                                                    398
               fort which may encounter unexpected setbacks such as poor primer characteristics .
               Hence, the faster an initial MRD target can be detected, the more time is available to de-
               sign reliable patient-specific quantification assays. To facilitate this, we developed a tar-
               geted nanopore sequencing assay, which provides comprehensive sequencing coverage
               of preselected fusion gene loci as well as the complex Ig and TCR loci within 48 hours.
 6             Furthermore, this data allows rapid identification of genomic breakpoint junctions with-  6

               in these loci to be utilized as personalized MRD targets.

               We retrospectively applied the assay to five KMT2A rearranged B-ALL and five SIL-
               TAL1 positive T-ALL samples. For eight of the samples we could report the genomic
               breakpoint coordinates of the fusion genes and design breakpoint-spanning primers
               within 48 hours of sequencing library preparation. Upon manual investigation as well
               as bioinformatic analysis of the sequencing data, we found proof of 86% of the diagnos-
               tically defined MRD targets for these ten patients, missing only four targets in total. For
               the DH3-10-JH2 rearrangement in B-ALL5, we could not find direct evidence, however,
               our long read sequencing data suggests a more complex rearrangement involving the
               DH3-10, JH2 and JH4 segments. Additionally, unbiased and independent investigation
               of potential MRD targets with the SV caller Sniffles focussed on the Ig and TCR loci
               yielded in total 32 additional validated rearrangements, which represent potential MRD
               candidates. Most of our detected rearrangements yielded a positive PCR product, albeit
               most were not patient-specific and also showed an amplification band in the polyclonal
               healthy control. This highlights the ability to detect Ig and TCR rearrangements from
               enriched nanopore sequencing data.

               We here for the first time performed targeted genomic long-read nanopore sequencing
               on the complex human Ig and TCR loci. These loci, which are very large in their germline
               state, harbour an extensive amount of V, (D), and J segments . After random joining
                                                                 411

                                                                                       163]]></page><page Index="172"><![CDATA[CHAPTER 6



            of one V, (D), and J segment, with the inclusion and deletion of random nucleotides in
            the joint regions, and excision of intermediate gene segments, these newly formed re-
            arrangements comprise a small but highly unique genomic region of less than 1kb .
                                                                                 394
            Furthermore, the individual gene segments (e.g. J segments) show high homology to one
            another which complicates the design of specific crRNAs and increases the chance for
            off-target effects. A recent study performed target enrichment capture using probes on
            the mRNA transcripts of these regions to track transcriptome profiles of clonal lympho-
            cyte populations in a breast cancer patient , however, no systematic targeting of these
                                               412
            entire genomic loci was performed. With our approach we targeted the respective ge-
            nomic loci from the last J segment, directing reads towards the D or V regions. In most
            cases, we had to apply a tiled crRNA approach to uniformly span this whole stretch. In
            total we designed 20 crRNAs to comprehensively cover all J regions of the IGH, IGL,
            IGK, TRA, TRB, TRD and TRG. While we do see enrichment at all of the targeted cut-
            points, we observe varying efficiency of the enrichment within and in between loci. Even
            though we do not observe a clear correlation between predicted crRNA efficiency and
            enrichment, intra-locus differences likely point to varying efficiency of the crRNAs. Op-
            timized crRNA designs and prior in vitro testing of the crRNA efficiency could help to
     6      achieve a maximal enrichment across all target sites .                                                                                                                          6
                                                      413

            The accuracy of nanopore sequencing at the single nucleotide level is currently subopti-
            mal which may lead to difficulties in identifying the exact junctional sequence of V(D)
            J rearrangements or with the classification of these high homology gene segments 414,415 .
            Some of these segments are only 10 bps in size or differ by only one nucleotide, which
            may further complicate accurate assignment of a unique V, D or J segment in case of
            suboptimal sequencing accuracy. Nonetheless, we here show that targeted nanopore se-
            quencing provides sufficient data to confidently map reads to unique genomic stretches
            within the Ig and TCR loci and to identify the underlying rearranged V, D or J segments
            by manual analysis of the provided genomic breakpoint coordinates. Key for the design
            of successful Ig/TCR MRD assays is the ability to reliably report the unique sequence
            of the newly formed breakpoint junction to facilitate the design of breakpoint-specific
                   396

            To implement this assay as a diagnostic tool further validations need to be performed.
            Thus far, we have retrospectively investigated ten samples. To accurately define the sen-

                                                                                  417

               prospective side-by-side comparison of current diagnostic methods and our technique
               is required to confirm the advantages of our assay with respect to time, accuracy and
               sensitivity to identify appropriate MRD targets for PCR-based assays.
               Taken together, we have developed a targeted nanopore sequencing assay for lymphoid
               leukemia patients to simultaneously identify recurrent fusion genes as well as the rear-
               ranged Ig and TCR repertoire. Our assay detects known and novel patient specific ge-
               nomic MRD targets within 48 hours after sequencing library initiation, a time-frame
               comparable diagnostic methods are unable to meet.



               Material and Methods


               Patient material
               This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clin-
               ical Practice, and informed consent was obtained from all patients or their guardians.
 6             Collection and use of patient material was approved by the institutional review boards of   6
               the Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

               DNA-Isolations

               Genomic DNA was extracted from blood or bone marrow with the QIAamp blood mini
               kit. Sample quality control was performed using a 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent),
               and DNA content was measured with a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher).

               crRNA design
               crRNAs  were  designed  as  previously  described .  In  brief,  the  known  target  fusion
                                                       403
               partners were designated as a 5’ or 3’ fusion partner, dependent upon known literature.
               Furthermore, the most common breakpoint locations for KMT2A, SIL, and TAL1 genes
               were extracted from a literature search and the most distal breakpoint locations were
               noted as extreme borders of the targeted area. For the Ig and TCR loci, crRNAs were de-
               signed adjacent to J segments, directing sequencing towards the (D)V segments.There-
               fore, genomic coordinates from the first to the last J segment were defined. If the un-
               known fusion partner or the V or D segments was the 5’ partner, crRNAs were designed
               as the sequence present on the minus strand of the gene (5’->3’) until the PAM sequence.
               If the unknown fusion partner or the V or D segments was the 3’ partner, crRNAs were
               designed as the sequence present on the plus strand of the gene (5’->3’) until the PAM
               sequence. Custom Alt-R® crRNAs were chosen with maximum on-target and off-target
               scores (IDT).

            Cas9-Enrichment and nanopore sequencing



            Cas9 enrichment and Nanopore sequencing was performed as previously described .
                                                                                 403
            In brief, approximately 1 µg of genomic DNA was dephosphorylated with Quick calf
            intestinal phosphatase (NEB) and CutSmart Buffer (NEB) for 10 minutes at 37 °C and
            inactivated for 2 minutes at 80 °C. crRNAs were resuspended in TE pH7.5 to 100 µM.
            For simultaneous targeting of multiple loci, crRNAs were pooled equimolarly to 100 µM.
            Ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) were prepared by mixing 100 µM equimolarialy
            pooled crRNA pools with 100 µM tracrRNA (IDT) and duplex buffer (IDT), incubated
            for 5 minutes at 95°C and thereafter cooled to room temperature. 10 µM RNPs were
            mixed with 62 µM HiFiCas9 (IDT) and 1x CutSMart buffer (NEB) and incubated at RT
            for 15 minutes to produce Cas9 RNPs. Dephosphorylated DNA samples and Cas9 RNPs
            were mixed with 10mM dATP and Taq polymerase (NEB) at 37 °C for 15 minutes and
            72 °C for 5 minutes to facilitate cutting of the genomic DNA and dA-tailing. Adaptor
            ligation mix was prepared by mixing Ligation Buffer (SQK-LSK109, ONT), Next Quick
            T4 DNA Ligase (NEB) and Adaptor Mix (SQK-LSK109, ONT). The mix was carefully
            applied to the processed DNA sample without vortexing and incubated at room tem-
     6      perature for 25 minutes. DNA was washed and bound to beads by adding TE pH8.0 and                                                                                               6

            0.3 x volume AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) and incubated for 10 minutes at room tem-
            perature. Fragments below 3 kb were washed away by washing the bead-bound solution
            twice with Long Fragment Buffer (SQK-LSK109, ONT). Enriched library was released
            from the beads with Elution Buffer (SQK-LSK109, ONT). Enriched library concentra-
            tion was measured with the Qubit Fluorometer 3.0 (Thermo Fisher).
            The library from one tumour sample was loaded onto one Flow Cell (R 9.4, ONT) ac-
            cording to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing was performed on a GridION X5
            instrument (ONT) and basecalling was performed by Guppy (ONT).

            Data analysis


            Nanopore sequencing data were mapped against the reference genome (GRCh38) with
            minimap2 (v2.12 ) with parameters ‘-x map-ont -a --MD’. Fusion genes were detected
                          344
            and reported as previously described with NanoFG . Mapped BAM files were split in
                                                      403
            the different IG and TR loci with samtools (v1.9 ). SV calling per loci was performed
                                                    418
            with Sniffles (v1.0.12 ) with parameters ‘-n -1 --report_BND --genotype -s 2 --max_

            num_splits 100 -d 100 -l 20’. Primer design for SV validation is automatized by using
            Primer3 (v1.1.4 ) with a product size range of 30-230 bp. Additionally, for each SV de-
                         349
            tected, supporting reads were used for consensus calling with 4 rounds of read overlap
            with minimap2 (v2.12 ) and Racon (v. 1.4.15 ) followed by polishing with Medaka
                                                   419

               PCR validation


               PCR validations were performed using the AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Ther-
               mofisher) protocol utilizing 50 ng DNA. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for
               5 minutes, followed by 14 cycles of 95 °C for 30 seconds, 65 - 58 °C decreasing n 0.5 °C
               increments, and 72 °C for one minute, followed by a further 24 cycles of 95 °C for 30
               seconds, 58 °C for 30 seconds, and 72 °C for 1 minute, and completed by 72 °C for 10
               minutes a hold at 10 °C.
               PCR products were then run on a 2% agarose gel at 100 V for one hour for assessment of
               assay specificity.

            Cancer is a genomic disease and tumors acquire somatic mutations throughout their
            origin and evolution. Some of these mutations give a tumor growth advantage over nor-
            mal cells (driver mutations) and most do not have selective effect (passenger mutations).
            Regardless, somatic mutations, including structural variants (SVs), uniquely identify and
            characterize a tumor and can be exploited in different ways. Mainly through targeted
            treatments that inhibit the growth advantages conferred by driver mutations, killing
            specifically the cancer cells. However, passenger events can also be used as cancer tags
            to differentiate tumors from normal cells and measure cancer dynamics. It is therefore
            possible to turn cancer’s biggest strengths, the acquired mutations and growth advantag-
            es, into its pitfall by leveraging genomic technologies for research and patients’ benefit.
            In this final chapter, I summarize several technological contributions presented in the
            previous chapters and discuss their potential and limitations.

            Organoids as a tool for ovarian cancer research


            Patient-derived cell lines are useful models that are nowadays relatively easy to estab-
            lish, maintain, genetically manipulate and are amenable to large high-throughput drug
            screening. However, more complex models represent the complexity and heterogeneity
            of tumors better. Patient-derived xenografts are in vivo mice models that provide a more
            realistic tumor environment, therefore increasing the predictive value of drug screens.
     7      They are however expensive, labor-intense and less suitable for large screening. More-                                                                                          7
            over, these xenografts might evolve towards a mouse-specific setting that, despite being
            in vivo models, deviates from the original tumor’s biology . Patient-derived organoids
                                                           115
            (PDOs) are faithful in vitro representations of the tumor characteristics, such as tumor
            heterogeneity and genomic traits, while allowing for high-throughput drug screening
            and genetic manipulation. PDOs have the potential to make personalized and targeted
            treatments for patients with ovarian cancer (OC) a reality and to be important model
            systems to improve our knowledge of cancer biology.


            In chapter 2 we describe a biobank of OC PDOs. This biobank represents multiple dif-
            ferent OC subtypes and is largely characterized at the histological, genomic, epigenomic
            and transcriptomic level, demonstrating the faithfulness to the original tumor material
            and stability over time. Furthermore, creating PDO biobanks of OC and other cancer
            types provides platforms for large scale drug screening and genomic and functional
            studies, as previously shown for colorectal cancer. The establishment of healthy fallopian
            tube organoids and patient-derived OC organoids has been reported independently by
            other groups 279,309,310,420 . All these studies show similar culture success rates to ours, which
            are lower when the obtained resected tumor material has been previously exposed to
            treatment, as is the case for most of our PDO lines. These independent studies also show


         174]]></page><page Index="183"><![CDATA[GENERAL DISCUSSION



               that the established PDOs are representative of the original tumor, with shallow genetic
               characterizations using targeted gene panels or whole-exome sequencing. We, however,
               provide a more comprehensive characterization with the use of whole genome sequenc-
               ing (WGS) for genomic, RNA-seq for transcriptomic and even methylation arrays for
               epigenomic characterization, showing that the PDOs are representative of the corre-
               sponding tumor and that the heterogeneity that characterizes OC is captured in the bio-
               bank. Moreover, by characterizing PDOs after long term passaging we show that those
               features are maintained well over time. We also show examples of potential applications
               of the biobank by using genome editing techniques to model the origin of OC and also
               performing drug screening with drugs that are commonly used in OC treatment, even
               assessing their response in vivo after xenotransplantation into mice.


               Another strength of our biobank is the establishment of PDO lines from different tu-
               mor locations of the same patient. While in chapter 2 we describe how the intra-patient
               genomic heterogeneity is preserved, in chapter 3 we expand to study how these related
               locations can respond differently to the same drug. There, we found differential respons-
               es to at least one drug in each of these patients. This suggests that tumor heterogeneity
               can also involve multiple locations of the same patient, influencing treatment efficacy
               and resistance development. Establishing organoids from all the tumor locations from
               a patient can enable the screening of multiple drugs and the selection of different effec-
 7             tive treatments that work for all of them. In order to achieve this stage, fast PDO culture   7
               establishment with high success rate to ensure that all locations from all patients can be
               represented in a clinically relevant timeframe, as well as standardized drug assays and
               well-defined controls to evaluate organoid response are needed.

               There are several possibilities to improve success rates when establishing organoid lines
               from patients with OC. Most of the tumors we sampled for organoid derivation had been
               previously exposed to chemotherapy, since the tissue samples were obtained during in-
               terval debulking as part of the standard treatment for OC. Therefore, the tumor viability
               might be already compromised prior to culture establishment due to the genomic dam-
               age induced by the chemotherapeutic agents. To overcome this, obtaining biopsies prior
               to chemotherapy exposure or selection of areas with higher tumor purity and viability
               prior to plating, would be ideal. Furthermore, different growth factors used in the medi-
               um might be driving selection for certain samples depending on their specific molecular
               characteristics. For example, nicotinamide is a growth factor used in our organoid medi-
               um and also in previous organoid biobanks. However, nicotinamide is also a PARP-in-
               hibitor, which is a compound that inhibits DNA repair by the homologous recombina-
               tion (HR) machinery. PARP-inhibitors are thus effective drugs for HR-deficient tumors,
               such as those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 inactivation. Nevertheless, in this case, it might be



                                                                                       175]]></page><page Index="184"><![CDATA[CHAPTER 7



            inhibiting the growth of HR-deficient organoids that are then under-represented in our
            biobank. None of the PDOs in our biobank was defined as HR-deficient according to
            CHORD, an algorithm that detects genomic evidence of HR-deficiency . Optimization
                                                                      421
            of the culture media and further investigation of possible selection effects might then
            improve culture success rates.

            A different approach than biobanking for the use of PDOs is the establishment of short-
            term cultures that can be used to rapidly screen relevant drugs for a particular patient.
            In chapter 3 we perform this rapid organoid establishment and drug screening for one
            sample, obtaining response results within three weeks after tissue collection. Addition-
            ally, other efforts show that it is possible to perform rapid and short-term culturing and
            drug screening of OC PDOs or PDO-like cultures, typically within weeks after tissue col-
            lection, albeit sacrificing extensive molecular characterization 279,309,310,420 . Nevertheless,
            larger cohorts of OC patients are needed to demonstrate that PDO models are represen-
            tative and predictive of the drug responses and clinical outcomes in patients, as proven
            in colorectal cancer 138,281 . Therefore, to maximize the clinical and research utility of PDOs
            rapid short term cultures for relevant drug screening should be established parallel to the
            expansion for biobanking.


            Finally, PDOs overcome practical challenges of cancer research using real tumor sam-
     7      ples, such as sufficient material available and possibility of genomic modification and en-                                                                                     7
            gineering, while providing a more faithful model than traditional cell lines as discussed
            above. It is essential to capture all the cancer complexity in OC and other cancer types to
            advance the use of PDOs as cancer research models. For example, understanding the or-
            igin of chemotherapy resistance and its prediction or detection is of utter importance in
            OC, since most patients respond well to initial chemotherapy treatments but relapse with
            resistant tumors. Paired organoids from patients before and after chemotherapy treat-
            ment would be relevant to study the mechanisms behind the acquisition of resistance.
            Another limitation of PDOs is the lack of a functional immune system, which is essen-
                                                          422
            tial to understand therapy response and tumor evolution . To overcome this limitation
            and bring the PDO in vitro system to the in vivo situation, co-culture systems of PDOs
            and immune cells are being developed 423,424 . Furthermore, in order to better understand
            the culture effects and differential drug responses in these organoid cultures, it would be
            interesting to further characterize these PDOs with multi-omics approaches that also
            detect presence of proteins, metabolites or neo-antigens. Perhaps a more extensive char-
            acterization beyond genomics might find explanations for the differential responses that
            we described in chapter 3.

               Challenges for somatic structural variation detection


               The role of somatic SVs in cancer has remained more concealed than for other mutation
               types. The lack of gold-standard benchmarks and best-practices workflows to detect and
               filter SV calls have reduced the impact of technological advances in the cancer SV field.
               Due to the chromosomal instability of tumors they rapidly accumulate more SVs than
               normal cells, often in clustered events. Therefore, care should be taken when transition-
               ing from germline SV detection towards somatic SV detection. It is essential to perform
               joint calling of tumor and normal pairs to discard SV events present in the germline.
               Additionally, somatic SV calls might present different characteristics than germline re-
               sulting from specific mechanisms of DNA damage active in tumorigenesis. Lastly, for
               somatic SV discovery a “kitchen sink” approach is often applied: try every available algo-
               rithm at the data and use the ensemble result. Apart from the computational concerns
               of this approach, Cameron et al.  demonstrated that this ensemble method does not
                                          359
               necessarily improve sensitivity and specificity of somatic detection. There is therefore a
               need for enhancement of methods in the field of somatic SV detection, and truth sets and
               benchmarks are essential for these developments.

               Gold reference truth sets of SVs have been established in germline individuals using
               integrative approaches with orthogonal genomic data from multiple sequencing tech-
 7             nologies. Chaisson et al.  and Zook et al.  show the importance of using long-read   7
                                   199
                                                  213
               data for comprehensive germline SV detection, especially when SVs fall in tandem re-
               peat regions and insertions. Both studies, however, emphasize the impracticality of per-
               forming this type of orthogonal approach in routine clinical practice, given the elevated
               costs and computational difficulties for data integration. Nevertheless, these benchmarks
               are essential to compare methods, algorithms and technologies and to establish optimal
               cost and sensitivity thresholds for SV detection. In chapter 4, we followed a similar or-
               thogonal approach to establish a truth set for somatic SV calling using the COLO829
               melanoma and paired COLO829BL normal cell lines derived from the same individual.
               Previous efforts have focused on SNVs and have therefore used only short-read data.
               Arora et al.  used the COLO829 cell lines and two others to benchmark two short-read
                        214
               sequencing platforms. Other somatic SV benchmarking efforts have made use of simu-
               lated data 330,331,359  or mouse genomic data , while stressing the need for a high quality
                                                 332
               truth set to enhance somatic SV method development.

               Surprisingly and in contrast to germline SV characterization studies, the contribution
               of long-reads in our somatic SV truth set was relatively low and the truth set was almost
               completely resolved with the short-read dataset alone. There are two possible reasons for
               this. First, somatic SVs might have fundamental differences compared to germline SVs.



                                                                                       177]]></page><page Index="186"><![CDATA[CHAPTER 7



            Due to the increased DNA damage or reduced DNA repair mechanisms in cancer cells,
            somatic SVs accumulate in more regions than just repeat-rich regions, perhaps mitigat-
            ing the added value of long-reads in these regions. Second, algorithms for somatic SV
            detection are more mature for short-read data than for long-read data. For example, a
            joint caller that identifies somatic SVs using simultaneous input data from tumor and
            matched normal from nanopore sequencing data does not exist, hindering the somat-
            ic SV discovery process for this type of data. Previous studies on somatic SV detection
            with nanopore data have reported high numbers of somatic SVs detected only by long-
            reads 208,209 . However, in contrast to our study, no experimental validation of the novel SV
            calls was performed in these studies. It is therefore likely that a large fraction of these are
            false positives. Nevertheless, with more optimal algorithms and experimental methods
            emerging, long-read technologies will likely improve their capability of somatic SV de-
            tection, and with our truth set we provide a resource to measure and benchmark this.

            Applications of somatic SV and nanopore sequencing in cancer


            Despite the current limitations of long-reads for somatic structural variation detection
            described above, long-reads in general and nanopore sequencing in particular still can
            provide novel contributions to cancer research and medicine. For example, application
            of long-read sequencing enables the identification of germline cancer-predisposing
     7      SVs that were not elucidated with short-read sequencing . Also, nanopore sequenc-                                                                                               7
                                                            425
            ing is currently being used to close current gaps in the human reference genome, par-
            ticularly regarding centromeres. An international consortium has managed to provide
                                                                  426
            telomere-to-telomere chromosome assemblies of chromosomes 8  and X , and has
                                                                          427
            ambitions to completely sequence end-to-end a human genome. Furthermore, another
                              178
            study by Ebbert et al.  reveals that with the use of linked- and long-read technologies
            a larger fraction of the genome becomes available, revealing disease-relevant genes that
            remained inaccessible by other technologies. More complete genome references and lon-
            ger reads, combined with optimal algorithms, might also aid to complete the somatic SV
            truth set that we present in chapter 4, where several copy number alterations that involve
            centromeres still miss an associated SV breakpoint.


            We leveraged other characteristics of nanopore sequencing apart from the long-read
            lengths: the simplicity and the rapid nature of the sequencing approach. Oxford Nanopore
            Technologies markets sequencing devices of small size, ranging between a USB stick to a
            small desktop machine. They attempt to bring sequencing closer to the patient and pro-
            mote in-house sequencing opposed to large centralized facilities, reducing the logistics
            needed in diagnostic laboratories. In chapters 5 and 6 we developed two assays to profile
            somatic SVs from tumor-only nanopore sequencing data. We show that the somatic SVs

               that we detect can be utilized as biomarkers to monitor tumor dynamics and to detect
               minimal residual disease. The use of somatic SVs as tumor-specific biomarkers is not
               a novel approach and has been described before 69,165,166 . The main advantage of somatic
               SVs as opposed to other types of genomic biomarkers is that the specific break-junction
               created can be detected by high-sensitivity PCR-based methods. In the studies referred,
               tumor-specific somatic SVs are detected approximately one month after tissue collec-
               tion. We, however, provide the tumor-specific biomarkers within a few days after tissue
               collection, given rapid nanopore library preparation and sequencing and the immediate
               availability of the resulting data. This is particularly relevant for evaluation of treatment
               response in patients by measuring the reduction in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).


               To extract relevant somatic SVs from noisy nanopore sequencing data from low cover-
               age tumor samples without a germline control we used two different approaches. First,
               in chapter 5, we used random forest classification to distinguish real SVs from false
               positives, followed by ranking of the positive candidates by likelihood of being somatic,
               based on SV size and labelling of known germline variants. We are therefore not dis-
               tinguishing between driver or passenger somatic SVs. Second, in chapter 6, we devise
               a wet-lab protocol with CRISPR-Cas9 technology to enrich the sequencing of regions
               that contain the relevant somatic SVs used for MRD tracing in leukemia, such as known
               fusion genes and the Ig and TCR loci. We are therefore targeting known leukemia SV
 7             driver events in this case.                                                  7

               In both of these assays, a main drawback is that they cannot be used for comprehen-
               sive genome-wide SV characterization, since we perform either low-coverage genome
               sketching or targeted sequencing. Also, distinguishing true somatic SVs is a significant
               issue regardless of the cancer driver status of the event, as these SVs might be lost during
               tumor evolution especially under the strong pressure selection amid treatment. We over-
               come this risk by selecting multiple somatic SVs in each sample, therefore decreasing
               the change of false negatives at the tracking step - when a biomarker is not detected even
               though there is tumor presence. We could find at least 5 biomarkers in each sample in
               chapter 5, which is in line with previous studies 69,165,166 . However, more data and larger
               cohorts are needed to determine an optimal number of SVs to monitor per patient, as
               well as to establish the sensitivity, specificity and prognostic value of the assays.

               Further potential improvements of our assays include the creation of large panels of ger-
               mline and somatic SVs based on population approaches. With such panels, we would be
               able to better distinguish germline from somatic SVs from our tumor-only low-depth
               sequencing approaches. For example, a recent project by the Genome Aggregation Da-
                                                                         428
               tabase (gnomAD) collected 433,371 germline SVs from 14,891 genome . Importantly,

            these resources need to be public and fully open access for the benefit of technologi-
            cal advance. Also, other groups have developed computational enrichment approaches
            with nanopore sequencing. Rather than using wet-lab Cas9-based enrichment, specific
            targeted regions are sequenced by mapping the read in real-time while it traverses the
            pore and rejecting it when it is not part of the target region 429,430 . This dry enrichment
            technique was used by Miller et al.  to enrich suspected regions and discover patho-
                                         431
            genic SVs in Mendelian disorders. By combining these computational enrichment with
            our approaches, perhaps more target regions and higher enrichments in cancer-relevant
            regions could be achieved, increasing confidence in the biomarkers that we detect and
            reducing post-analysis validation.

               Final remarks



               In this thesis I introduced and discussed several approaches that leverage state of the art
               genomic technology for the advancement of cancer research and diagnostics. I expect
               that the assays and resources presented here will be of use to the international cancer ge-
               nomics and cancer research community. Our OC PDO biobank serves the OC research
               community and shows potential to also impact the OC clinical care. Continued estab-
               lishment and expansion of PDOs will help reach this potential, as discussed above. Fur-
               thermore, I leverage SVs, which have been traditionally overlooked in cancer genomics,
               and long read sequencing technologies and provide community resources and personal-
               ized medicine approaches that use somatic SVs, overcoming previous technological lim-
               itations. With the speed that genomic technology advances, maybe these approaches will
               become outdated in the next few years with new technologies, methods and algorithms.
               Nevertheless, the contributions presented here are relevant to drive this technological
               advance by pushing the limits of the state of the art of cancer genomics.

            Summary



            Cancer genomics is a thriving field with constant methodological and technological
            advances. These developments enable personalized and targeted treatments for cancer
            patients based on the unique genomic profiles of tumors. In this thesis I leveraged novel
            technologies for the advancement of cancer research and care. In chapter 1 I introduced
            the different types of genomic variation, the genomic characteristics of cancer, the im-
            portance of genomic technology for personalized medicine and the potential of liquid
            biopsies for low-invasive cancer monitoring. I also introduced model systems used in
            cancer research, including patient-derived organoids (PDOs), detailing the potential for
            their use particularly in ovarian cancer (OC). Lastly, I introduced the role of somatic SV
            in cancer and the different sequencing technologies that are used to detect them, along
            with the challenges that this presents.


            In the first part of this thesis, we used organoid technology to advance OC research. In
            chapter 2 we established and characterized a PDO biobank that faithfully represented
            the disease, and presented its applications. The biobank consisted of 56 PDO lines from
            32 patients and included all the main histological subtypes of OC. We characterized the
            organoid lines at the histopathological, genomic and epigenomic levels and showed how
            these lines faithfully recapitulated the original tumors. We also demonstrated that these
            characteristics were maintained over time and extensive culturing. Furthermore, tran-
            scriptomic analysis showed that the PDO lines from the different OC subtypes clustered
            together based on expression patterns. Intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity was repre-
            sented in the biobank. We also presented proof-of-concept for drug screening studies
            with these PDOs, with different subtype responses to platinum-based chemotherapy.
            Resistance to chemotherapy in recurrent disease was also reflected in the biobank. Last-
            ly, we showed that the PDOs could be xenografted into mice for in vivo drug-sensitivity
            assays and that PDOs were amenable to genomic modification to study tumorigenesis
            (for tumorigenesis study). Overall, our results highlighted the potential of organoids to
            advance OC research.


            Next, we expanded the OC-PDO biobank and used those PDOs for extensive drug
            screening in chapter 3. We performed screening assays on 36 PDO lines derived from 23
            patients and retrospectively compared their drug responses to clinical responses of the
            patients. Evaluating several clinical biomarkers, we showed that PDOs recapitulated pa-
            tient response to chemotherapy and targeted treatments. I.e. the most responsive PDOs
            in drug screening assays had been derived from patients that had better clinical response
            to the same treatment. Furthermore, inter- and intra-patient drug response heterogene-
            ity was found between different PDO lines and could be partially explained by genomic

               aberrations. Lastly, we were able to obtain drug response results within three weeks of
               tumor sampling, illustrating the short turnaround time needed for these assays, a critical
               feature for clinical implementation. Overall, these results highlighted the importance of
               deriving PDO lines from multiple tumor locations of a patient, when applicable, to im-
               prove drug response prediction and clinical decision making based on PDO assays.

               In the second part of the thesis I focused on somatic structural variation in cancer. Ac-
               curate detection of structural variants (SVs) is still challenging, and truth sets and stan-
               dardized workflows are lacking. We tackled the challenge of accurate somatic SV detec-
               tion in cancer genomes and generated a truth set of somatic SVs that can be used for
               method development and benchmarking, which I presented in chapter 4. We performed
               genome-wide analysis of the paired melanoma and normal lymphoblastoid COLO829
               cell lines. We sequenced these cell lines to a high depth using four different sequencing
               technologies: Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, Pacific Biosciences and 10X Genomics. We
               also performed experimental validation, including Bionano optical mapping data, to en-
               sure that the truth set was reliable and complete. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of
               the truth set by determining the SV detection performance of each technology as a func-
               tion of tumor purity and sequencing depth. This gold-standard truth set, together with
               the underlying multi-platform genomic characterization of this cancer cell line pair, are
               an important resource for benchmarking and method development efforts in the cancer
               genomics community.

               Furthermore, we developed methods to utilize long-read sequencing and somatic struc-
               tural variants (SVs) for cancer dynamics after treatment and minimal residual disease
               tracing. In chapter 5, we developed an assay that leveraged nanopore sequencing tech-
               nology for rapid detection of somatic SVs from a tumor. We used low-coverage whole-ge-
               nome sequencing of a tumor with nanopore technology and then used filtering and
               random-forest classification to select the most likely somatic SV candidates. We could re-
               trieve these biomarker-candidates within three days after tissue obtention. These somatic
               SVs could be used, after validation, as patient-specific biomarkers for cancer tracking in
               circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by ultra-sensitive PCR methods. We applied our assay
               to ten ovarian and prostate cancer samples and obtained multiple biomarkers per sample
               in mere days. We demonstrated retrospectively that longitudinal monitoring of cancer
               dynamics was feasible using these somatic SV biomarkers. Summarizing, our method
               enabled rapid and cost-effective identification of a set of patient-specific SVs that can be
               used to study ctDNA dynamics.

               We also developed an assay that leverages CRISPR-Cas9 based enrichment of genom-
               ic targets in pediatric leukemias from the lymphoid lineage. In chapter 6, we targeted



                                                                                       209]]></page><page Index="218"><![CDATA[ADDENDUM



            loci recurrently involved in genomic rearrangements in these leukemias, such as the im-
            munoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) loci, and the KMT2A and SIL-TAL1 fu-
            sion-gene loci. These loci are widely used as PCR-based minimal residual disease (MRD)
            tracing based on the patient-specific rearrangements. We applied our assay to ten acute
            lymphoid leukemia samples and showed that we successfully enriched the fusion, Ig and
            TCR loci. We successfully validated known MRD targets in these patients within two
            days after sample obtention and identified an additional set of patient-specific rearrange-
            ments. Our approach poses as an attractive alternative to current multi-step biomarker
            identification assays in lymphoid leukemia, with increased speed and detection sensitiv-
            ity.


            Finally, in chapter 7 I discussed and reflected on the technological advances presented
            in the previous chapters. I explained the advantages of PDO technology in OC research,
            but also the challenges for its further clinical implementation in clinical care. Similarly, I
            identify current challenges and propose several solutions for enhancing the knowledge
            of the role of somatic SVs in cancer and implementation of long-read sequencing. In
            conclusion, this thesis proposes several cancer genomics technological opportunities to
            advance cancer research and develop personalized diagnostic assays to improve patients’
            outcomes.

               Samenvatting



               Onderzoek  naar het  kanker  genoom is  dynamisch  en  gaat gepaard met  constante
               vooruitgang op zowel methodologisch als technologisch vlak. Deze ontwikkelingen
               maken gepersonaliseerde en gerichte behandelingen voor kankerpatiënten mogelijk op
               basis van de unieke genomische profielen van tumoren. Voor dit proefschrift heb ik geb-
               ruik gemaakt van nieuwe technologieën voor de verbetering van kankeronderzoek en
               -zorg. In hoofdstuk 1 heb ik de verschillende soorten genomische variatie, de genom-
               ische kenmerken van kanker, het belang van genomische technologie voor gepersonali-
               seerde geneeskunde en het potentieel van vloeibare biopsieën voor minimaal invasieve
               kankermonitoring geïntroduceerd. Daarnaast heb ik modelsystemen geïntroduceerd
               die  worden  gebruikt  bij  kankeronderzoek,  waaronder  PDO's  (patiënt-afgeleide  or-
               ganoïden), waarin het potentieel voor hun gebruik, met name bij eierstokkanker wordt
               beschreven. Ten slotte heb ik de rol van somatische structurele variaties (SVs) bij kanker
               geïntroduceerd en de verschillende  sequencing technieken die worden gebruikt om ze
               te detecteren, samen met de uitdagingen die dit met zich meebrengt.


               In het eerste deel van dit proefschrift hebben we organoïden technologie gebruikt om
               onderzoek naar eierstokkanker te bevorderen. In hoofdstuk 2 hebben we een PDO
               biobank opgezet en de toepassingen ervan gepresenteerd. De biobank bestond uit 56
               PDO-lijnen van 32  patiënten en omvatte alle belangrijke histologische subtypes van
               eierstokkanker. We hebben de organoïde lijnen gekarakteriseerd op histopathologisch,
               genomisch en epigenomisch niveau en lieten zien hoe deze lijnen nauwgezet de oor-
               spronkelijke tumoren nabootsten. We hebben ook aangetoond dat deze kenmerken na
               langdurige kweek behouden bleven. Verder toonde analyse van het transcriptoom aan
               dat de PDO-lijnen van de verschillende subtypen van eierstokkanker samen clusteren
               op basis van expressiepatronen. Ook was de heterogeniteit binnen en tussen patiënten
               vertegenwoordigd in de biobank. We presenteerden tevens een proof-of-concept voor
               drug screeningsonderzoeken op deze PDO’s met verschillende subtype-reacties op pla-
               tina-bevattende chemotherapie. Resistentie tegen chemotherapie bij recidief kwam ook
               tot uiting in de biobank. Ten slotte hebben we aangetoond dat de PDO's konden worden
               getransplanteerd in muizen voor in vivo medicatie gevoeligheids assays en dat PDO's
               bruikbaar waren voor genetische modificatie voor onderzoek naar tumorgenese. Onze
               resultaten tonen het potentieel van organoïden om eierstokkankeronderzoek te bevor-
               deren.

               In hoofdstuk 3 hebben we de PDO biobank van eierstokkanker uitgebreid en de PDO's
               gebruikt voor uitgebreide drugsscreening. We hebben screenings uitgevoerd op 36
               PDO-lijnen die zijn afgeleid van 23 patiënten en we hebben retrospectief de reactie van


                                                                                       211]]></page><page Index="220"><![CDATA[ADDENDUM



            de PDO-lijnen op medicatie vergeleken met de klinische respons van de patiënten. Door
            verschillende klinische biomarkers te evalueren, hebben we aangetoond dat PDO's de
            respons van de patiënt op chemotherapie en gerichte behandelingen nabootsen. De
            meest responsieve PDO's in de screenings voor medicatie waren afkomstig van patiënten
            die een betere klinische respons hadden op dezelfde behandeling. Bovendien werd inter-
            en intra-patiënt heterogeniteit van medicatie respons aangetoond tussen verschillende
            PDO-lijnen en kon deze gedeeltelijk worden verklaard door genomische afwijkingen.
            Tot slot waren we in staat om binnen drie weken na het afnemen van tumorweefsel re-
            sultaten te verkrijgen over de respons op medicatie, wat de korte doorlooptijd die nodig
            is voor deze assays illustreert, een cruciaal kenmerk voor klinische implementatie. Al
            met al benadrukken deze resultaten het belang van het verkrijgen van PDO-lijnen van
            meerdere tumorlocaties van een patiënt om de voorspelling van medicatie respons en
            klinische besluitvorming op basis van PDO assays te verbeteren.
            In het tweede deel van het proefschrift heb ik me gericht op somatische structurele
            variatie in kanker. Nauwkeurige detectie van SV's is nog steeds een uitdaging, en vast-
            gestelde referentiesets en gestandaardiseerde workflows ontbreken. We zijn de uitdag-
            ing van nauwkeurige somatische SV-detectie in kankergenomen aangegaan en hebben
            een referentieset van somatische SV's gegenereerd die kan worden gebruikt voor het
            ontwikkelen van methoden en benchmarking, wat ik in hoofdstuk 4 heb besproken. We
            hebben een genoom-brede analyse uitgevoerd van de gepaarde melanoom- en normale
            lymfoblastoïde COLO829-cellijnen. We hebben deze cellijnen met diepe coverage gese-
            quenced met behulp van vier verschillende sequencing technieken: Illumina, Oxford
            Nanopore, Pacific Biosciences en 10X Genomics. Ook hebben we experimentele vali-
            datie uitgevoerd, inclusief Bionano optische mapping, om ervoor te zorgen dat de refer-
            entieset betrouwbaar en volledig was. Ten slotte hebben we het nut van de referentieset
            aangetoond door de SV-detectie prestaties van elke technologie te bepalen afhankelijk
            van de zuiverheid van de tumor en de sequencing diepte. Deze referentieset, samen met
            de onderliggende multi-platform genomische karakterisering van dit kankercellijnen-
            paar, is een belangrijke bron voor benchmarking en methodologische ontwikkeling in
            het genomics veld.


            Daarnaast hebben we methoden ontwikkeld om ‘long-read’ sequencing en somatische
            SV's te gebruiken om de dynamiek van kanker na behandeling te bestuderen en om
            minimale restziekten op te sporen. In hoofdstuk 5 hebben we een assay ontwikkeld
            die gebruikmaakt van Nanopore sequencing technologie voor snelle detectie van so-
            matische SV's in een tumor. We hebben met lage coverage een tumor gesequenced met
            Nanopore technologie en hebben filtering en random-forest-classificatie toegepast om
            de meest waarschijnlijke somatische SV-kandidaten te selecteren. We konden deze bio-
            marker-kandidaten binnen drie dagen na ontvangst van het weefsel terugvinden. Deze

               somatische SV's zouden, na validatie, kunnen worden gebruikt als patiënt-specifieke bio-
               markers voor het volgen van kanker in circulerend tumor-DNA (ctDNA) door middel
               van ultragevoelige PCR-methoden. We hebben onze assay toegepast op tien ovarium-
               en prostaatkankermonsters en hebben in slechts enkele dagen meerdere biomarkers per
               monster verkregen. We hebben in retrospect aangetoond dat longitudinale monitoring
               van de kankerdynamiek mogelijk was met behulp van deze somatische SV-biomarkers.
               Samenvattend maakte onze methode een snelle en kosteneffectieve identificatie mogelijk
               van een reeks patiëntspecifieke SV's die kunnen worden gebruikt om ctDNA-dynamiek
               te bestuderen.

               We hebben ook een assay ontwikkeld die gebruik maakt van op CRISPR-Cas9 geba-
               seerde verrijking van genomische targets bij pediatrische leukemieën uit de lymfoïde lijn.
               In hoofdstuk 6 hebben we ons gericht op loci die herhaaldelijk betrokken zijn bij gen-
               omische herschikkingen bij deze leukemieën, zoals de immunoglobuline (Ig) en T-cel-
               receptor (TCR) loci, en de KMT2A en SIL-TAL1 fusiegenen loci. Deze loci worden veel
               gebruikt voor op PCR gebaseerde tracering van minimale restziekte op basis van de pa-
               tiëntspecifieke herschikkingen. We hebben onze assay toegepast op tien acute lymfoïde
               leukemie monsters en hebben aangetoond dat we met succes de fusie, Ig en TCR loci
               hebben verrijkt. We hebben met succes bekende doelen van minimale restziekte bij deze
               patiënten gevalideerd binnen twee dagen na ontvangst van het monster en we hebben
               een aanvullende reeks patiëntspecifieke herschikkingen geïdentificeerd. Onze aanpak
               vormt een geschikt alternatief voor de huidige meerstaps biomarker-identificatie assays
               bij lymfoïde leukemie, met verhoogde snelheid en detectiegevoeligheid.


               Ten slotte heb ik in hoofdstuk 7 de technologische vooruitgang die in de vorige hoofd-
               stukken zijn gepresenteerd bediscussieerd. Ik heb de voordelen van PDO-technologie
               voor eierstokkankeronderzoek uitgelegd, maar ook de uitdagingen voor de verdere im-
               plementatie in de klinische zorg. Daarnaast besprak ik de bestaande uitdagingen om-
               trent somatische SV’s en stel ik verschillende oplossingen voor om de kennis van de rol
               van somatische SV's bij kanker en implementatie van Nanopore sequencing technologie
               te vergroten. Concluderend stelt dit proefschrift verschillende kanker genomics geba-
               seerde technologische mogelijkheden voor om kankeronderzoek vooruit te helpen en
               gepersonaliseerde diagnostische assays te ontwikkelen om het ziektebeloop van patiënt-
               en positief te beïnvloeden.

            Acknowledgements



            What an accomplishment to write a thesis! But even though only my name appears on
            the cover, many more people are responsible for this success. Some of their names can
            be read throughout the chapters but others have had a more indirect but equally relevant
            role. I have tried to compile all those names here. However, there are so many that the fear
            of forgetting a name (never a person) is real. So, if you feel that you should be here, then
            you definitely are and shame on me. Thank you so much!


            I want to start by thanking Wigard for giving me the opportunity to start my PhD and for
            all the enthusiasm and ideas that started all the projects that I have written here. Edwin,
            thank you for taking me into your group for the last part of the PhD and for all the help
            in the last push. Thank you to the members of my doctoral examination committee, prof.
            Susanne Lens, prof. Emile Voest, dr. Jeroen de Ridder, prof. Hans Kristian Ploos van Am-
            stel and prof. Tobias Marschall for taking the time to critically read this thesis. Thank you
            to prof. Ronald Zweemer and prof. Els Witteveen for their guidance through the years
            and for their different and very necessary clinical point of view. Also thank you to dr. Jan
            Molenaar for his guidance through the PhD supervision committee.

            To the triples, Chris and Christina. I simply would not have made it without you. Apart
            from your obvious contribution to most chapters in this thesis, thank you for always be-
            ing there to carry me through the difficult times (mostly winter and when back from
            holiday). Thank you for all the coffees, walks, tears, cakes, breakfasts, lunches, dinners,
            games, skiing, sailing, travel surprises and everything else that we have had and will con-
            tinue having together. Chris, thank you for your kindness and positive energy. I have
            learned a lot from you about life, gynaecology and plenty of interesting medical facts.
            Looking forward to the day you party with us. Stay yellow! Christina, thank you for up-
            grading me from colleague to friend so quickly (even though there was a short regres-
            sion at some point). Thank you for carrying me through with much needed deadlines
            (seriously), thank you for many lasagnas and some vodka-snows, but mainly for your
            contagious kindness and serenity that I keep learning from you. Extended thank yous to
            Rob, Victor (and Pau!) for forming the quintuples, hopefully we can all meet again soon,
            Meanwhile, take care of these two!


            To the Wizards, it was really a shame that our group fell apart. Thank you for all the rotat-
            ing activities and dinners and Thursday morning meetings (with mandatory cookies!).
            We even went up the Alpe d’Huez together! Mircea, thank you for showing me around
            the UMC and around Utrecht. We shared many coffees, (long) lunch breaks, random
            conversations, retreats, beers and shots and I missed all of it after you left. Mark, thank

               you for helping and teaching me so much and always with a smile and a joke. I really
               thought I would not manage when you left the UMC. Ivo, thank you for all the knowl-
               edge about beer and whisky, and for generating almost all the data I have used. Glen,
               thank you for all the support and glentoring, and for literally carrying me up a mountain
               (twice!). Ellen, thank you for your enthusiasm, support and mentoring and for always
               being there for a late evening venting chat. Joline, thank you for keeping up with all the
               OC meetings and for your clinical point of view that brought a lot into the group. Ales-
               sio, thank you for your passion and for an unforgettable amount of beer at Regensburg.

               Ies, Sander, Luan, thank you for adopting me for the last year of my PhD. It was not the
               smoothest time and you all helped to make it better. Keep up the great work but more
               importantly keep having fun every day. Special thanks to my officemates: Judith, thank
               you for all the late PhD venting and for translating the samenvatting. I am sure you will
               have a very successful end of your PhD. Roel, thank you for a lot of random news and
               threads that started with speciation, many puns (most of them were good), for your help
               and for being my open-source guru. 

               Thank you to all the colleagues from the Genetics department and the CMM for all the
               retreats, masterclasses, (theme) borrels, sorely missed through 2020, and overall fun and
               healthy work environment. There are too many people to mention them all but if you
               feel included in this acknowledgement it is because you are. Miguel, thank you for all
               the (long) lunch and coffee breaks, keeping me updated with the gossip and intense ping
               pong games on Fridays. Joske, thank you for your enthusiasm, you were definitely a ma-
               jor contributor to the fun mentioned above. You are brilliant and any group is lucky to
               have you, even remotely. Also thank you to all the workers that make things run smooth-
               ly in our daily work life, starting with Monique and Cristina, always there to solve all the
               daily PhD student headaches, but also including HPC and IT, cleaning and horeca staff. 


               Thank you to all the collaborators that made this thesis possible. To Oded and Kadi from
               the Hubrecht Institute for all their organoid work, it was a pleasure working with you. To
               Anouk and Martijn from the Erasmus MC, thank you for believing in our nanopore idea
               and making it a reality with enthusiasm.

               Jose Antonio Espejo Valle-Inclan was born on March 4th 1992 in Sevilla, Spain. He grew
               up in Madrid with his parents and younger sister. He attended primary and high school at
               Instituto Ramiro de Maeztu in Madrid, where he also discovered a passion for basketball.
               After graduating with honors in 2010, he started his Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry
               at the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid. In the last year of those studies, in 2014, he fol-
               lowed bioinformatics and programming elective courses, which prompted him to move
               countries and start a Master of Science in Bioinformatics at Wageningen University, the
               Netherlands. During his master thesis and internship, he started working with genome
               and transcriptome assembly and nanopore sequencing technology in the field of plant
               pathology. In 2016 he moved to Utrecht to start his PhD at the University Medical Center
               Utrecht under the supervision of dr. Wigard Kloosterman and prof. Edwin Cuppen, of
               which this thesis is the final product. He will continue his career as a postdoctoral fellow
               at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) in Cambridge, UK.
